# 2024-06 Asterion Log
*Original Date: June 1, 2024*
*Session Four: Into the Tomb (cont.) & Pursuit of the Child Breakers*

## Summary
Returning from the first tomb exploration, the companions seek answers from [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s mentor [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]] about the mysterious grudge [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] bears against him. This inquiry unveils the horrific truth about the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]] - monsters who mutilate children for profit. The revelation sets the companions on a path of righteous vengeance that will lead them into the dangerous [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]] to confront an ancient evil.

## Chapter 6 – Pursuit of the Child Breakers

Retracing their path to [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]], the group stops again at the roadhouse where they encountered [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]'s gang. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] asks the proprietor about them, but learns only that [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] had been served a pricy variety of Elven mead that had previously been placed in the innkeeper's custody for the gang's visits. For a sizeable gratuity, he pours a cup for [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] to sample.

The adventurers arrive at [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] on schedule, uncertain of what reception they will find. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] keep their appointment with [[Dramatis-Personae#Big Victor|Big Victor]], who seems about as non-threatening as he probably can be. He reports that [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] has gotten wind of the other criminal gangs' intentions, and fled town a couple days prior. Vic thanks [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] for his efforts, and expresses his trust that [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] will cause no more trouble for the local crime bosses, absent abuses such as led to [[Dramatis-Personae#Stoat|Stoat]]'s demise. He assures [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] that no one else in the city has any dealings with the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], and they will not object to any further action the adventurers take against those villains.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] depart, somewhat reassured that they are not targeted by the thieves of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]], but still a little apprehensive, and resolved to leave town for a spell to let things cool down as they take action against the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]].

### The Horror of Wassford

The adventurers set out for the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]], finding the travelling expeditious following the old Volcian road East out of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]]. Camping in local barns along the way, they eventually reach the town of Remius, where they seek information about their destination. The [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]], as their name implies, are rugged, densely wooded, and boggy. Nominally divided between a Gallian and Imperial counties and a handful of small Prince Bishoprics, much of it is trackless wilderness, dotted with a few hot springs.

While nobody acknowledges mention of the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], there are a few tales about the fearsome lizard men of the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]], who occasionally raid its fringe settlements or hunters, woodcutters, or would-be miners who venture into it. The lizard man tribes allegedly share the Fens with an ancient dragon that they worship as a god, and present as offerings any captives that they do not eat themselves. No neighboring nobles have thought it productive to press a fight against the tribes, and while it has been suggested that a campaign in the winter might be productive, with the lizard men naturally in torpor, the hot springs and low-level volcanic activity of the region apparently keep it hospitable to them, offsetting that vulnerability.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] plans the route for the next leg of the journey, which will depart from the Volcian road some distance north, and follow the river Less to the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Rockfort|Rockfort]], which is said to sit on haunted caves that riddle the highlands of the Fens. The party continues on its way up the road to the north, as the weather turns less hospitable. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] is able to keep the worst of the rain at bay with magic, and the pace of travel is unimpeded.

### The Meeting with Colthan

Arriving at [[Places-of-Asterion#Wassford|Wassford]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] observe the children they see wandering about suspiciously and unsupervised, tracking them to locate [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]]'s hideout in an abandoned barn. The rest of the group follows [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abbey of St. Martin|Abbey of St. Martin]], securing beer and hard cider for [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], and a taste of spirits (specifically pear brandy) for [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] finds no other goods of interest, but they do hear some interesting gossip – there are some tales of "[[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s War", and supposedly a necromancer is at large – though details of any zombie threat prove elusive.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]] is a welcoming host, thanking [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] profusely for her financial support. He explains that conflict with [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] stems from the boss's patronage of "[[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]" – dastardly folk who inventively mutilate children to maximize their begging income. Appalled, the heroes vow to bring [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]], and the larger, apparent cult, to rough justice. [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]] also offers some more details on "[[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]]".

### The Truth About Corin Quickpath

[[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] was apparently a tenant farmer 30-some years ago, with a wife and family in the southern county of Rodia, who had taken up side-businesses of poaching, smuggling, and banditry. Captured and facing execution, he had escaped and fled north, ending up as a scout for the Count of Perch, first in the Cathari Crusade, and then against [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s army. When the Count turned to burning forests in the course of the war, [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] had switched sides, joining up with [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]], and eventually becoming her lover. Still later, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s atrocities mounted, he apparently betrayed her and fled, and it was in pursuit of [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] that she and her guards were ambushed and killed. [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]], who had been a old friend of [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]], saw him only once after [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s demise, and knows only that he had mentioned intending to return to Rodia in search of his family.

The group heads home shortly after their conference and, now familiar with the path, and with favorable weather, presses themselves to complete the journey in a single day. Discussing their options, they agree to seek more information on the "[[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]" and pursue vengeance against [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]].

### The Rescue Mission

They spend most of the next day searching for beggar children with suspiciously elaborate injuries, and are eventually directed by a churchman to a boy with flipper-like hands and feet. They observe him until dusk, when he is picked up by an older ruffian and tossed over a donkey and taken to a crumbling, disused tower of the old city wall.

Seeing no activity around the tower, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] scales it and enters through an open stairway. Descending as her comrades close in, her foot catches a thread that rings a small bell. Spotting someone charging up the stairs in the darkness, she vaults off the stairs toward the tower door. Reaching it before her pursuer, she opens it and ducks to the side, leaving an open shot for [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], who puts a crippling crossbow bolt into the groin of the ruffian observed earlier.

The group quickly assembles in the tower, finding 5 beggar children including the apparent Breaker victim. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] heals their "minder" a bit to revive him, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] tweaks the embedded bolt to compel his cooperation. He professes to have purchased the group of urchins from [[Dramatis-Personae#Stoat|Stoat]], presumably on behalf of [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]], but to know nothing more of their origin. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] twists the bolt further until the minder passes out again, and then pitches him into the tower's cellar/latrine.

### Andre's Testimony

The flipper-afflicted beggar, a nine-year old boy who identifies himself as [[Dramatis-Personae#Andre|Andre]], has more useful information. He tells our heroes that he had been orphaned in the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lot|Lot]], and passed through a few hands before being taken to an isolated stockade in the deep woods of the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]]. There he had been mutilated, both physically and apparently magically, by the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], after which he was moved by road and boat, begging at several towns before arriving in [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]].

On Monday the 9th, the group, with the aid of their new donkey, delivers the rescued children to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Daughters of God Convent|Daughters of God]] convent north of the city, along with a $120 contribution to help provide for their care. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] then canvass the streets of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] seeking contact with the crime bosses whose turf adjoins [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]]'s, and manage to arrange a morning meeting with "[[Dramatis-Personae#Big Victor|Big Victor]]" the next day.

### The Arrangement with Big Victor

"Vic" is, at turns, conciliatory and menacing – expressing limits to his patience with [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s "equalizing" activities, but admitting that they seemed justified in some cases, particularly that of [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Stoat|Stoat]]. Importantly, he states that he and the other bosses share distaste for [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]]'s dealings with the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], their belief that he is currently weak, and their interest in partitioning his turf. He requests that the group give him a week to negotiate that partition, and then act to bring [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] down, but then leave the city themselves. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and company agree, if the bosses will have no further dealings with the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], and will agree to donate a portion of the proceeds of the neighborhoods' income to help support the [[Places-of-Asterion#Daughters of God Convent|Daughters of God]].

With a week before the details of the deal can be ironed out, and an interest in avoiding entanglements in the city in the meantime, the group decides that it might be worth traveling to [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]], to see if the directions in the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Volcian Property Deed|Volcian Property Deed]] can, indeed, lead them to the "alleged tomb".

*Thus did the companions learn that some evils are so foul that they demand immediate action, regardless of personal risk or political consequence. The rescue of the children was but the first step in a campaign that would lead them into the very heart of darkness.*
