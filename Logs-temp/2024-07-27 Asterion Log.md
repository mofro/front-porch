# 2024-07 Asterion Log
*Original Date: July 27, 2024*
*Session Six: The Maestro's Lair*

## Summary
The companions continue their assault on the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' fortress, descending into the underground lair of the mysterious "[[Dramatis-Personae#Maestro|Maestro]]." There they face twisted magic as [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s own sword arm turns against him, battle fearsome ogres, and discover disturbing evidence of dark rituals involving children. Their victory over the orc shaman reveals valuable magical items and confirms the connection between the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]] and the [[Places-of-Asterion#Underworld|Underworld]].

## Chapter 8 – The Maestro's Lair
[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] turns to face the ogres with steely-eyed resolve, but feels a chill and brief vertigo as they close with him. His instinctive control of his sword arm seems to betray him, bringing his blade down not on the ogres, but his own leg! Gritting his teeth, he retains his footing and dodges his other attackers, but remains horrified by his lack of control of his own limb.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] sees [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s distress, and lunges from the back of the cave to [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s aid. He strikes one of the ogres, distracting him from the Caledonian, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] readies spells. The ogres are unable to land substantial blows, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s traitorous arm strikes again as he struggles to thwart it. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] leaps to evade attack, and hooks the club of one of the ogres, disarming him. That ogre resorts to attempting to grapple with [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], while the other concentrates on [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]].

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] enters the chamber to see the fallen [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], and moves to aid or revive him before he's trampled by the massive combatants grappling over him. She makes no progress with [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], who is not so much unconscious as stupefied from the bullet, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] thinks that [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s predicament may be due to a spellcaster in the darkness of the cave from which the ogres charged. She looses arrows in that direction, without discernible effect, while remaining on guard against possible strikes from the ogres around her.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] hurries past [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] into the fray, but catches sight of a third ogre who has taken an alternate path around the column that divides the cave chamber. He strikes with his pick before the ogre can react, and bloodily disembowels him. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] is winded by a strike from his foe's club, and falls back, attempting to heal himself. The ogre presses his attack, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] is spared another blow by a jet of acid from [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]. The ogre shrieks and wheezes as he falls in a gooey pile.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] struggles to fend off the remaining ogre and his own arm -- bleeding from repeated blows from the latter, but still managing to keep standing. At last [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] reaches his side, strikes again with his pick, and is soon continuing his advance through another flood of ogre blood.

With the ogres down, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] charges to the door from which they came where the spellcaster must lurk. But she recoils from a blow to the head, and falls dazed not far from [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], however, has advanced to where he can see the foe with his infravision, and recognizes it as a tall and wizened orc shaman, wielding a staff carved from a rack of elk antlers. The orc attempts to parry [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s enraged blow, but he crumples just as surely as the ogres, twitching as the dwarf twists and tears the pick out of his foes viscera.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] advances to be sure that the room behind the door is clear, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] moves in support with his lightning still charged, while the rest of the heroes minister to their wounds. There seems to be some rudimentary bedding for the ogres, a simple table and seats, and off to one side another bolt of [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Giant Spider Silk|giant spider silk]] cloth, as well as a bolt of more common white linen. Another tunnel leads to a cave through which a stream flows, falling from a higher tunnel on one side and exiting a hillside to the surface on the other.

The chamber where the battle occurred seems to have been the center of the "[[Dramatis-Personae#Maestro|Maestro]]"s activity. Near the entrance was a barred cell, in which little remains but scattered straw and waste. Nearby, a primitive altar is scattered with ritual items – Some animal teeth, bones carved with glyphs, and a simple dagger -- probably used as an athame. Some fragments of parchment are found to bear elvish script, and a few phrases of notably flowery and archaic prose – "...hope/wish to maintain/continue a connection/friendship/union that will blossom/flower... healthily/beneficially/profitably...".

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] sings to heal himself and others, and moves to search the shaman's apparent living area as [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] returns to use his more powerful magics to treat [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s leg. He confirms the crudly decorated soapstone block to be a box, and removes the lid to find it twice as large inside as out. It contains little now, however, but 4 stoppered gourds and one earthenware flask full of liquids, and an assortment of herbs and small bones. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] identifies the liquid in the gourds as "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Paut Potions|paut]]", a potion used to alleviate fatigue from spell casting, and the flask as holding a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Major Healing Potion|Major Healing potion]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] notes that while the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Soapstone Box|box]] weighs close to 100lbs, nothing placed inside it seems to add to that weight.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] overcomes his multiple layers of distaste to inspect the shaman's remains. He takes a helmet, apparently fashioned from the skull of a dire boar, but finds the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Elk Horn Staff|elk horn staff]] distinctly repulsive to handle. While it clearly contains powerful magics, he believes it to have been crafted by some more powerful shaman or wizard to be usable only by its intended wielder.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] makes his way to the exit tunnel, seeking tracks from whomever they had originally been pursuing down into the cave, but had never found. There are tracks that seem to veer into the stream on their way out, but the specific trail is then lost. He sees traces of older footprints on the bank upstream, however. In that direction, he notes a faint glow of phosphorescent fungus near the waterfall, and an old glyph carved into a prominent rock...

He points the glyph out to [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], who connects it to the presence of the orc – Such creatures are generally not known to range through [[Places-of-Asterion#Gallia|Gallia]], but the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Underworld Glyph|glyph]] could well be a sign used by denizens of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Underworld|Underworld]] to mark points of access to that tunnel network, said to connect points all across Asterion, and perhaps the world. While [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] has heard of the existence of such signs, neither he nor [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] can connect them to a specific race – be they dwarves or goblins or orcs or troglodytes, or possibly some other, less reliably reported.

The group collects its loot and returns to the surface, where the boy, [[Dramatis-Personae#Cedric|Cedric]], waits, still bound. They collect the assorted weapons and semi-valuables from the guards, as well as the rescued children, in the donkey cart. They head back toward town, debating how to proceed in breaking up whatever sort of conspiracy might have been supporting the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]].

## Unexpected Justice
Not far outside of [[Places-of-Asterion#Rockfort|Rockfort]], as the sun begins to clear the trees, they see a substantial group approaching on the trail. They make sure their most important valuables are concealed as they walk, but see the group spread into the woods as they draw closer. They soon identify mounted knights at the head of the group, who hail them, announcing that they are investigating an attack on a trading post at the old fort outside of town. This was apparently reported by a survivor of the attack, a peasant woman, who accompanies them. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] belatedly recognize her as the person who ducked down the tree/ladder, inadvertently leading them to the "[[Dramatis-Personae#Maestro|Maestro]]'s" lair.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] announces that the fort was the center of the "[[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]'" operation before their attack put an end to it. The woman, [[Dramatis-Personae#Maud|Maud]], briefly denies the charges, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] adds the specifics of the "[[Dramatis-Personae#Maestro|Maestro]]"s involvement, and compounds his tale by revealing the children, the captive [[Dramatis-Personae#Cedric|Cedric]], and the orcish shaman's [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Dire Boar Skull Helmet|helmet]]. She seems to have no counter to such evidence, and shrinks back as the knight's master rides forward to take charge.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] recognizes, by the noble's arms, that he is [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Matthias of Overland|Baron Matthias of Overland]] himself, and alerts the rest of the group before he comes within earshot. Stout of build and impressively armored in mail, he is somewhat less than regal in bearing, seeming a bit hung over at this early hour. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] restates his case, confidently but ingratiatingly, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Matthias of Overland|Matthias]] refocuses his displeasure from the morning sun and birdsong onto [[Dramatis-Personae#Maud|Maud]], who, still unable to justify herself, is roughly restrained by the foot guards.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Matthias of Overland|Matthias]] and some of his knights return with [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] to survey the scene of the carnage. The Baron and his knights are somewhat cautious, and he comments wryly on the novelty of being led on a tour by a blind man, but they are shown the "child breaking" facilities, and seem duly appalled.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] remains curious about the couple in town who had received the bolt of spider silk earlier and, on their return to the group, suggests that the Baron and company head back to their hovel. The guards apparently recognize [[Dramatis-Personae#Cedric|Cedric]] as the son of those peasants, and they swiftly search the house, finding the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Giant Spider Silk|spider silk]], and apprehending [[Dramatis-Personae#Claude|Claude]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Margaret|Margaret]], who seem frightened, but can offer no excuses for their or their son's actions. All four suspects are swiftly sentenced to hang, and the deed is carried out in the town square of [[Places-of-Asterion#Rockfort|Rockfort]] before dusk. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] notes that the legality of the judgment was probably highly questionable, but criminal law is probably more crudely enforced in the Empire than in [[Places-of-Asterion#Gallia|Gallia]], and when a noble has been rousted from slumber and apparently lied to by peasants, about such heinous crimes, he is likely to administer justice that much more swiftly and roughly.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] asks if the Baron is indeed the "Slayer of the Elf Queen". [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Matthias of Overland|Matthias]]' headache seems soothed by a bit of pride and wistfulness, and he proceeds to cheerfully relate how he and a force of knights had been pursuing [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] for some weeks, before discovering her one night, unarmored, and with but a small escort. Proceeding to defeat the guards handily, he had personally closed to dispatch the Queen with a single blow of his heavy maul. Asked if friendly elves had provided any assistance, the Baron seems to belatedly recognize his audience as containing a few elves, and flashes a brief smirk before acknowledging that yes, they may have offered some small aid.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Matthias of Overland|Matthias]] thanks the group for ending the menace of the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], but given the questionable legality of their own actions, encourages them to leave his lands swiftly. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] requests a warrant to ensure that they can travel without being subject to further tolls, and the Baron's scribe promptly prepares one. The group returns to [[Places-of-Asterion#Gallia|Gallia]], reaching [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] on Thursday, June 2.

*As the companions left [[Places-of-Asterion#Rockfort|Rockfort]], they couldn't help but feel that justice, crude though it may have been, had been served. Yet [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], keen of perception despite his sightless eyes, sensed that [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Matthias of Overland|Matthias]]' smirk betrayed something more about [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s fall than he was willing to share openly.*
