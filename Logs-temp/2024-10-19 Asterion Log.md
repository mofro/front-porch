# 2024-10 Asterion Log
*Original Date: October 19, 2024*
*Session Nine: Cash Out*

## Summary
Having successfully claimed the treasures of the ancient tomb, the companions must now navigate the challenges of transporting and selling their newfound wealth. Their journey back to [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] brings unexpected encounters including a surprise "royal tax" when a powerful elven ambassador demands a contribution to King Ludovic's ransom fund. Their fortunes take another turn when they depart south, only to encounter the enigmatic elven bandit [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] once more.

## Chapter 12 – Cash Out
The adventurers sort through their new wealth and commence loading it onto the donkey cart, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] take the swords and shields of the warrior skeletons back to town, selling them for some working cash. The day drawing to a close, the group decides to camp out in the woods at the tomb entrance to spend the night.

While breaking camp in the morning, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] & [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] hear activity in the woods, and all pause until the intruders seem to withdraw. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] climbs into the treetops and approaches the edge of the woods, eventually spotting a plainly-dressed man camped out along the edge of the road. Suspecting that he is a woodsman or game warden, and has sent a companion away for assistance, the party decides to depart deeper into the woods, and soon reaches the river Liger before picking its way further toward [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]].

In sight of the city, the group realizes that the bridge that is their only easy route north will expose them to a search of their cart, potentially leading to onerous taxation, or inconvenient questions about their treasure's origin. They reverse course west to get out of the city's view, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] head into town to arrange for a boat to act as ferry. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], preferring to avoid a boat crossing anyway, remains in town and finds a kennel where he purchases a guard-trained mastiff that he names "[[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin|Puddin']]". The crossing is managed uneventfully, and the group reunites for the night in the northern suburbs of [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]].

Working their way north, the adventurers reach the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Stamp|Stamp]] on Wednesday, June 15. They settle into an inn, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] posts [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin|Puddin']] to guard their cart for the night. As [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] plays his hurdy-gurdy through the late evening, the inn grows more crowed and boisterous. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] note a couple of suspiciously behaving characters apparently pickpocketing their way through the crowd, possibly cloaked by illusions, as an elderly woman begins to distinguish herself as the most agile and energetic dancer. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] suspects that the old woman may actually be [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]], and moves in an attempt to collide with her, in hopes of disrupting the spell. While seemingly oblivious, the woman deftly dances around [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] without contact, but her startling nimbleness is enough to satisfy [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] that her suspicions were correct. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] departs to check on [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin|Puddin']] and the cart. The group follows in turn, save for [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], who continues playing, but notes that the elderly dancer seems now to be merely middle-aged.

In the stables behind the inn, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] finds [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin|Puddin']] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Bobby the Burro|Bobby the burro]] well, and the cart secure, but sees shadows moving among surrounding wagons, animals, and drowsy or clueless attendants. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] remain on guard, but try to keep an eye on activity in the inn as well.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] and the dancer seem to be mutually inspirational – [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] plays with exhilaration, until the dancer, by now a striking blonde just out of her teens, scoops up the bowl of coins from the floor, kisses him farewell, and departs with a few others.

The adventurers keep watchmen on guard until morning, when the various wagoners begin to annoyance and concern over missing items as they mobilize. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] manages to deflect any suspicion about the thieves having overlooked his party, and they make a quick departure north. They reach [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] the following day, and leave various items in the custody of the [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel|Professore]] for examination, agreeing to meet later to discuss his findings. They sell the copper "oxhide" slabs to a brownsmith.

## The Royal Contribution
As the adventurers pass time while [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and the [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel|Professore]] research their various finds from the tomb, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] meets with the criminal boss "[[Dramatis-Personae#Big Victor|Big Vic]]", inquiring whether the boss might need certain services provided by him as a "third party". [[Dramatis-Personae#Big Victor|Vic]], while a cordial host, notes that despite his own favorable feelings toward the group, the other gangs in town feel uneasy about them – this having been why he had earlier urged them to remove themselves from the city. Were [[Dramatis-Personae#Big Victor|Vic]] to retain their services, he is concerned that it would result in paranoia and, possibly provoke violence among the gangs. He encourages [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] to enjoy a good lunch, and then depart.

Over the following week, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] sells off most of the bulkier items from the tomb, such as the gilded cauldron, the bronze breastplate, and the urns of various incense. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] identifies the capabilities of most of the magic items collected from the tomb and the [[Dramatis-Personae#The Necromancer|Necromancer]], and they are either handed off to whomever can best utilize them, or (in the case of the drunkenness-inducing satyr stature), sold. The gold device from the tomb, apparently of elven manufacture, is determined to be an oracular device. If its lamps are lit, the rotors will turn and cast moving shadows. Cast on a surface about 5' away [½(π*the diameter of the device)] away, the shadows can be interpreted to answer questions. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] obtains a circular tent of layered canvas of the appropriate dimensions to act as a "theater" for the device.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] also has his hammer's head adorned with silver fittings, hopefully the better to deal with any future vampires, and continues to train his hound. He also finds a dwarven smith in town, [[Dramatis-Personae#Durcon Surefist|Durcon Surefist]], who has some facility with the old dwarven heroic script in which the copper plate book from the tomb is inscribed. [[Dramatis-Personae#Durcon Surefist|Durcon]] reports that it discusses the history and culture of the lizard men before the fall of their civilization (framed as a warning on the wages of decadence). It is potentially provocative in human/Christian circles for chronological details describing a timeframe of tens of thousands of years, well beyond the span of biblically described history.

On Thursday, June 23, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] return to the [[Places-of-Asterion#University of Lutetia|University of Lutetia]] to meet the [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel|Professore]], and are surprised to find another guest present – an Elf of unusually large and powerful build, and apparently well armored under his cloaks, who identifies himself as [[Dramatis-Personae#Lord Lithlaeron Oryathar|Lord Lithlaeron Oryathar]] – Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the court of King Ludovic of [[Places-of-Asterion#Gallia|Gallia]], for High King Ananrond Ondolithe of the Celestial Realm of the White Mountains. He explains that he is acting as representative of Queen Mother Bianca, and that they are seeking contributions for the ransom fund for the King and other royals recently captured in [[Places-of-Asterion#Aegypt|Aegypt]], and that as they are aware that the adventurers seem to have recently come into possession of some wealth, he hopes that they will be able to provide support.

The [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel|Professore]] intervenes in the dialog, explaining that has been examining some coins and minor artifacts for the group, of interest for their historical value – [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] infers that this means that the royals do not know about the sarcophagus or other major items of loot and, responding to [[Dramatis-Personae#Lord Lithlaeron Oryathar|Lithlaeron]], hedges on any contribution. The Elf Lord, however, proposes a sum of $10,000. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] enters the conversation, suggesting that amount is close to the total amount of their recent windfall – an assertion that, while inaccurately low, is more than [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] would have preferred to concede.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Lord Lithlaeron Oryathar|Lithlaeron]] notes that he was requested to make the solicitation because it was believed that he, as an elf, would be better received by the group, given its predominantly non-human ethnicity. He assures them that he has no interest in simply extorting funds, and that the Gallian rulers are in legitimate and urgent need of contributions. He further offers a written note of receipt, under seal, which will act to certify the group's good standing with the royals, and also that future offers of employment may be forthcoming. Apprehensive about the consequences of outright refusing to contribute, and having limited room to negotiate, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] agrees to contribute. He reserves judgment, however, on whether offers of employment will be acceptable, depending on the specifics.

After [[Dramatis-Personae#Lord Lithlaeron Oryathar|Lithlaeron]] departs, the [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel|Professore]] apologizes for the awkward encounter, though he can offer little additional insight as to how the group was targeted, apparently being as shocked as the adventurers are. He shares the bits of historical insight that he can regarding the sarcophagus and coins. The heroes adjourn to collect and deliver their "contribution", and receive the promised document of receipt. They then promptly recoup their losses by selling the dwarven book to the [[Places-of-Asterion#University of Lutetia|University]] through the [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel|Professore]], and the sarcophagus to a silversmith.

## Chapter 13 – On The Road Again
Heading south, according to their original plan to seek out the home of [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]], the group departs [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]], arriving in the northern suburbs of [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]] on Monday, June 27. Setting up [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]' tent, the adventurers plan their next move with the aid of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Shadow Engine|oracular device]]. Posing the question of where [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]] might be found, they see images of woodlands in a mild climate – likely far to the south of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]], and in keeping with their previous direction to his early home near [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Ifran|St. Ifran]].

Another query, about the whereabouts of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]], produces murkier images, possibly indicating magical interference with the oracle. This is less than surprising, given that the armor apparently remains unfound, in spite of many seekers with access to magic being in search of it.

The heroes decide to take a course diverting east around the hazardous [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] region, via the River Roth. The next day they head East along the river Liger. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] continues to support their travel by playing his hurdy-gurdy in the various inns enroute, but laments a certain lack of inspiration after his exhilarating collaboration with the disguised [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]. On Friday, July 1, at a roadhouse in the village of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ligerkilns|Ligerkilns]], his inspiration seems to return, followed by an appearance by the elf bandit and her entourage in the flesh. She apologizes for her hasty departure in [[Places-of-Asterion#Stamp|Stamp]], and dances playfully to [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]'s accompaniment, apparently "decorating" the roadhouse with a magical glamour of garlands of flowers and jeweled bangles as they perform.

Her companions seem to grow a bit agitated, probably sensing intervention by the authorities. Her "young boy" cupbearer is seemingly dispatched to get her attention and encourage her departure. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] draws the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Selfish Scribe|"Selfish Scribe"]] obtained from the [[Dramatis-Personae#The Necromancer|Necromancer]], and moves to intercept the boy, striking the scribe across the back of his hand, apparently unnoticed. It produces a scar that only [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] seems to be able to see.

With some persistence, the boy does get [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]'s attention – the spell is literally broken, and the adornments of the room dispelled. She bids adieu to [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], and pauses on her way out the door to acknowledge [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]. She apologizes if he felt neglected, but expresses her wish that "perhaps we can all play together other night". She and her band ride north into the forest of [[Places-of-Asterion#Morvan|Morvan]] in the darkness.

*As the adventurers made camp that night, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] examined the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Selfish Scribe|Selfish Scribe]] in the firelight, pondering what she'd learned about [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]'s young cupbearer. The invisible mark she'd placed on his hand might prove valuable in future encounters, but she kept her actions to herself, not yet ready to share her suspicions with the others. Meanwhile, [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]'s fingers still danced across his instrument, trying to recapture the strange magic of playing alongside the enigmatic elven bandit.*
