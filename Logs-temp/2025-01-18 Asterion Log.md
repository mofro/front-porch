# 2025-01-18 Asterion Log
*Original Date: January 18, 2025*
*Session Twelve: Claiming The Bounty*

## Summary
Having cleared the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]] of its mystical guardians, the companions explore the tower courtyard and discover the basilisk's remains. They negotiate with [[Dramatis-Personae#Countess Alix of Ludonum|Countess Alix of Ludonum]] for their reward and receive valuable compensation for their services. With new provisions and permissions to travel freely, they set off on their continued quest to find [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]], heading southwest toward the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] where they encounter an undine and her unwelcome guest.

## Chapter 15 – Claiming The Bounty

The adventurers spend the night in the tower's entry hall, giving the basilisk ample time to proceed with melting. On the morning of Saturday, July 9, they proceed to explore the tower courtyard. They find mostly dusty earth, devoid of life, but scattered with numerous rusty parts of armor and weapons which they gather to sell as scrap.

Collecting their assorted spoils, they return to town, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] takes his letter of introduction to seek an audience with the Count of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]]. They make an appointment for the next day, passing the rest of Saturday with minor shopping, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] commencing analysis of the magical items. He identifies the various bottles of liquid from the "broken glass" level as failed alchemical experiments, with a few bottles of distilled spirits. A bottle of bluish liquid has a particularly appealing smell, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] gives [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] a whiff in hopes she'll be able to identify it. The water nymph responds aggressively, guzzling down the whole bottle of what is later determined to have been an ultra-refined, "Essential" sort of intoxicating spirit, perhaps 10 times as potent as the conventional sort. [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] spends the next 36 hours in blissful stupor, only her own elemental nature permitting her to survive the experience.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] attend the next day's audience, which turns out to be with [[Dramatis-Personae#Countess Alix of Ludonum|Countess Alix of Ludonum]], as the Count, Guy, is still captive in [[Places-of-Asterion#Aegypt|Aegypt]] with much of the rest of the top tier of Gallian nobility. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] offers the group's services in investigating and securing the various rumored magical sites of Forest-Ludonum – The [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]], the [[Places-of-Asterion#The Garden of the Two of Us|Garden of the Two of Us]], and St. Peter's Height.

The Countess seems indifferent to the disposition of most of the sites, but the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]], owing to its fortification, and commanding position along the Volcian road, overlooking the city of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]], is of definite interest.

She explains that the site of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]] was granted as a Life Estate to a wizard named [[Dramatis-Personae#Astaragat|Astaragat]] some 300 years ago by the King of Arles, as reward for his services in battling raiding orcs and Saracens in the area. The County of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]] passed to the Counts of Forest some 40 years ago, but the land grant remained in force. The duration of "life estates" granted to wizards can be contentious, but traditionally lapse three score and ten years after the last confirmed report of the holder's living presence. The tower has, in fact, been believed vacant for about 100 years, though Imperial troops reportedly disappeared while attempting to investigate the tower about that time. Another group of guards sent by the current Count's father about 20 years ago was lost, with one survivor's report indicating the presence of a Basilisk, and no one was keen to press the investigation.

While the Countess laments that she cannot offer cash for the adventurers' services, she does offer other compensation – room, board, and smithing services in the city of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]] and village of Forest, and a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Countess Alix's Toll Pass|pass to avoid tolls]] in the Counties of Forest and Ludonum for the group and 1,000lbs of cargo for a period of 10 years. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] considers seeking some sort of claim on the tower itself, but decides against pressing his luck given the reasonably valuable offer for work already done.

The adventurers return to the tower the next day, keeping an eye out for spies, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] does note someone lurking at the treeline when they reenter the dungeon tunnel. The group makes a point of breaking a little glass and causing other commotion in the courtyard, before returning to to town on Tuesday, July12. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] have another audience with the Countess, at which they pronounce the tower cleared, keeping the details vague, and mentioning only the Basilisk as a significant foe overcome. [[Dramatis-Personae#Countess Alix of Ludonum|Countess Alix]] seems quite pleased in any event, both at the tower being secured and [[Dramatis-Personae#Astaragat|Astaragat]] not being present. Though [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] is not present at the audience, she grants the group the additional award of a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Letter of Introduction to Theodorus|letter of introduction to Theodorus]], the Court Wizard of the County of Campatena.

The heroes finally relax in an evening of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]] nightlife to the accompaniment of [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]'s musical stylings, and pick up rumors and gossip. They hear it said that [[Dramatis-Personae#Countess Alix of Ludonum|Countess Alix]] has bristled a bit at being left as steward with Count Guy on crusade, as she, slightly older than her new husband, actually has a bit more campaign experience than he. Apparently she accompanied her father, the Baron of Clearview, on a crusade in the Holy Land about 12 years ago, and actually donned his armor and led troops when he was unfit due to illness. Other tales seem to clarify why she gave a letter of introduction to [[Dramatis-Personae#Theodorus|Theodorus]], as her father was a vassel of the Count of Campatena, and she is said not to get along with the current Court Wizard of Forest, Simon, who is part of the retinue currently imprisoned in [[Places-of-Asterion#Aegypt|Aegypt]] in any event.

## Heading Southwest

The adventurers leave [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]] the next day, proceeding down the road along the river Roth, keeping their distance from its banks to avoid local traffic and barge tows. They pay a toll to cross into the Imperial county of Vivry near dusk, spending the night in an inn in the village of [[Places-of-Asterion#Annonay|Annonay]] filled with pilgrims and travelers either fleeing or seeking the uprisings around [[Places-of-Asterion#Arles|Arles]] and [[Places-of-Asterion#Avenio|Avenio]] to the south.

They learn that the conflict, instigated by the dowager Countess, Beatrice of Liguria, are apparently growing, aggravated by the fact that the King's youngest brother, Karl, has not, in fact, yet returned from Saracen captivity in [[Places-of-Asterion#Aegypt|Aegypt]]. The adventurers are confident, however, that their course around the south edge of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] will steer clear of the conflict.

Marching south, they spend the night of the 14th in an inn outside the walls of the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Vivris|Vivris]], and diverge more sharply from the Roth the next day. The terrain grows a bit more rugged and wild, with fewer farms and settlements, and there is no toll or other obvious signs as they leave Vivry for the Gallian County of [[Places-of-Asterion#Tholoza|Tholoza]]. Crossing the Ardesca river over a natural bridge, they pay a toll imposed by local authorities, but find no other settlements by dusk, and camp by the roadside.

Continuing to the southwest the next day, they spend the night of Saturday the 16th at a nearly empty inn in the village of [[Places-of-Asterion#Alest|Alest]]. They find the alewife talkative, as the village is off the usual pilgrimage and major trade routes. There's some trade between the Lordship of [[Places-of-Asterion#Uzes|Uzes]] to the southeast and the walled town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Mimata|Mimata]] in the County of [[Places-of-Asterion#Gabalum|Gabalum]] to the Northwest, but travelers as exotic as the adventurers are infrequent. In [[Places-of-Asterion#Gabalum|Gabalum]] and the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]], they are told, is the Tarn Plateau, known for numerous ominous standing stones and at some risk from raiding goblins and bandits, occasionally including adolescent elves, notorious for their lawless adventurousness.

## The Undine's Request

As they journey west, the party skirts along the foot of steep hills, and in the late afternoon passes a particularly striking waterfall that plunges into a broad, swirling pool. There [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] spies a glimmering humanoid figure which addresses him and bids him approach. He soon recognizes its tall, voluptuous form as a human-sized version of [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] – a water elemental, or "undine". She identifies herself as "[[Dramatis-Personae#Roufichtra|Roufichtra]]" – the guardian spirit of this place – and imperiously insists that he dispose of an entity that has intruded in a cave behind the waterfall, and defiles it by its presence. [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]], though she remains hidden in her carrying skin, is noticably uncomfortable in [[Dramatis-Personae#Roufichtra|Roufichtra]]'s presence. She nevertheless counsels [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] to comply with the demand.

The rest of the adventurers agree to support [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] in the endeavor, anticipating treasure and figuring that it is undesirable to make an enemy of the undine. They make their way behind the waterfall into a cramped, muddy tunnel extending up into the hillside. As their path crosses a vertical shaft, dimly lit from above, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] spies a looming form on an overhead ledge a moment before a chimera leaps down to attack.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] deflects a claw blow with his shield, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] are struck by the firey breath of two of the creature's heads. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] heads off more damage from his burning clothes with Move Fire spell transferring the flames from himself back to the beast. The adventurers swiftly counterattack, and their combined blows fell the chimera quickly, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] striking off two of the creature's three heads in a single second!

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] collects some of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Chimera Venom|venom]] from the creature's snake-headed tail, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] clambers up to the ledge where it came from. There she finds a pile of [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Golden Statuettes|golden statuettes]] amounting to about $2,800, and a large, and potentially valuable, chunk of transparent [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Rock Crystal|rock crystal]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] scouts on through the tunnel, and finds that it exits onto the heights overlooking the waterfall pool.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] returns to declare the group's success to [[Dramatis-Personae#Roufichtra|Roufichtra]], who responds smugly, but with apparent satisfaction with their efforts. She makes no demands on their plunder, and does not restrain their departure but, taking no chances, the heroes lead [[Dramatis-Personae#Bobby the Burro|Bobby the Burro]] with their cart to the hilltops where they can load it from the cave's "back door" and depart unseen.

*As the companions made camp that night, counting their [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Golden Statuettes|golden statuettes]] and examining the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Rock Crystal|rock crystal]] by firelight, they couldn't help but feel that this journey was becoming more profitable than they had anticipated. Yet the looming presence of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] ahead, with their ominous standing stones and rumors of goblin raiders, suggested that the true challenges of their quest still lay before them.*
