# 2025-02 Asterion Log
*Original Date: February 15, 2025*
*Session Thirteen: In Search of Corin Quickpath*

## Summary
The companions arrive at [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Ifran|St. Ifran]] and begin their search for [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]] in earnest. They discover his abandoned homestead near [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Victor|St. Victor]] and learn that his family fled west during the Cathar Crusade. More importantly, they encounter "[[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]]," an elf who knew the centaur [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], who in turn was seeking [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] in the deadly [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]]. After purchasing a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Small Powerstone|small powerstone]] and [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Directions to Forest of Stone|directions to the forest]], the companions prepare to face the forest's legendary guardian - a gorgon from whom no one has reportedly returned.

## A Town of Warnings
The heroes reach [[Places-of-Asterion#Vigan|Vigan]] in twilight on Sunday, July 17th, feasting on mutton in the small but busy sheep herding town. They hear more warnings of goblin raiders, marauding in spite of the Count of [[Places-of-Asterion#Gabalum|Gabalum]]'s "ear bounty."

They continue the next day to the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Cubertoria|Cubertoria]], and pause at the Knight's Templar Commandery so that [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] can explore its library. He donates a copy of his historical treatise to gain access, but finds little of interest there. Before settling in for the evening, the group erects its tent and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] attempts a divination utilizing the strange [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Shadow Engine|"shadow engine"]] they recovered from the [[Dramatis-Personae#Vampire Chief|vampire chief]]'s tomb. Asking about [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]]'s location, he manages no insight, but asking about his home, he perceives an image of a woodland hovel, though no other guidance as to its whereabouts. Later that night, [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] continues to hone his performing arts, more than covering their costs at the inn.

## The Search for Corin Quickpath
On Tuesday the 19th, the party finally reaches the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Ifran|St. Ifran]] (named for an ancient Volcian church father who actually hailed from that continent), and fans out to inquire about the location of [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]]'s home. At least a few locals recognize the name, as a former local poacher who was arrested, but escaped, later becoming a ranger/scout for the Count of Perch, but later joining the army of [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]], though no one seems aware of his having ultimately turned on her. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] do obtain directions to the village of [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Victor|St. Victor]], near which his home was located.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] unsuccessfully seek magical powerstones, and recruit [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s assistance. She encounters an Elf in town who offers a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Small Powerstone|small, 4 point, stone]]. With little knowledge of the value of such things, but ample adventuring cash to offer, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] obtains it for $850. She returns to the Breadbasket Inn, where, that night, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] joins in with [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]'s performance for a particularly crowd-pleasing and profitable show.

The next day, the adventurers explore [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Victor|St. Victor]], finding about the same level of knowledge about [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]], and directions to his old home about 3 miles through the woods from the village center. The trail to reach it is much overgrown, and the home site long abandoned and much decayed. Near the front door, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] notes a stray piece of slate on the ground which lies shattered, apparently by a horse's hoof, though how long ago can't be determined.

Finding no clues at the homestead, the group seeks anyone in the village with relevant knowledge, and finds an older alewife, named Aerlene, who knew [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]]'s family. She corroborates the story of his arrest and escape some 35 years ago, and notes that his family was said to have fled west during the Cathar Crusade, when hostile armies marauded through all the counties of southern [[Places-of-Asterion#Gallia|Gallia]]. She knows nothing else about where they might have gone or their ultimate fate. She did hear of Corin having returned and inquiring his family about 25 years back, but didn't see him personally then, and hasn't since. Aerlene does know that [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] was said to have befriended a Centaur, named [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], while in [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s service. She claims to have seen the Centaur around [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Victor|St. Victor]] as recently as 10 years ago, though not any more recently, and remembers him being seen in the company of an elf known as "[[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]]".

## The Dread Forest of Stone
The adventurers return to [[Places-of-Asterion#St. Ifran|St. Ifran]] in hopes of following up on their new information, but little is forthcoming, and the consensus appears to be that there are no significant elf settlements in the forests north and west of town. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] continues inquiries, and is eventually is steered to "[[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]]", who [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] recognizes as the elf who sold her the powerstone.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] seems a bit "shifty", but talkative, and seems willing to give assistance. He explains that he never met [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]], but was indeed knew the Centaur [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], who fought alongside [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] as part of [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s army during her revolt. [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] supposedly abandoned her cause some time before [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]] did. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] asks whether [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] had fought in the rebellion, a question the elf brushes off somewhat dismissively, claiming with a smile that he was "very young back then".

When the group inquires as to [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]]'s current whereabouts, [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] says that he fears the worst, as the Centaur had been searching the area for [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Quickpath]], who he believed had been seeking the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]]". The adventurers have heard rumors of such a place previously, supposedly inhabited by a lethal demon, and from which no one has supposedly ever returned. [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] clarifies that, as he has heard the tale, the "demon" is specifically a gorgon named [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakeńdrixris]], and reports that he indeed supplied the centaur with directions. Ten years having passed with no sign of [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] assumes that he found what he was seeking.

The group apprehensively inquires about getting the same directions, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] offers them for $500. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] skeptically asks how he can be sure of the legitimacy of the directions, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] explains that he's conservative by nature – if he were to sell bad directions, he'd run the risk of the customer coming back for revenge. By selling accurate directions, given that no one ever returns from the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]], he's guaranteed to be safe from dissatisfied customers.

With continued resistance to the price of the directions, [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] offers to potentially accept items in barter rather than cash, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] offers the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Elven Knife (balisong)|elven "butterfly" knife]] he obtained from [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] back in [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]]. He sidesteps the elf's inquiry as to how he obtained the knife, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Squire|Squire]] ultimately seems pleased to accept it, and presents a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Directions to Forest of Stone|handkerchief-sized silken cloth]] bearing a detailed and seemingly animated map of the route, that only the magically empowered [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] are able to see clearly.

The adventurers ruminate on the risks of facing a gorgon, and its possible vulnerabilities. Recognizing how little is definitively known about such creatures, they can only resolve to "not get turned to stone", but recognize that in the best case they will still likely have to deal with reviving [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] and/or [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]]. As this seems to be beyond the capabilities of their own magic-users, it is proposed that the party travel to the cathedral town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]] enroute – seeking an audience with the bishop or some lesser clergy in search of assistance on their quest, or at least in reviving anyone petrified. Despite the risk of making a substantial detour only for [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] to make an enemy of a bishop, the group sets out.

## Securing Divine Aid
They reach [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]] in twilight on the evening of July 21. They see on the following Friday morning that in addition to its surrounding curtain wall, a second wall divides the town internally, its sovereignty being apparently split between the Count of Rodia and the Bishop of Rodess. The heroes top up their supplies and are able to arrange a meeting the following day with Monsignor Roderick, Vicar for the Churchhold of Rodess.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] declares that the adventurers plan to journey into the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] in search of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]], and to slay the gorgon said to dwell there. While he suggests that Church support would be useful to the endeavor, the Vicar seems unresponsive, explaining that Church resources are limited. He does, however, reassure the group that those resources would be available to heal any members of the group who might be maimed or incapacitated on their quest, and offers a ritual blessing to the party before it sets out. While this is less than they might have hoped for, no less-than-cordial words are exchanged, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] concedes that the meeting went better than he had feared.

The adventurers set out, duly blessed, on Sunday morning, July 24, passing through the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Balton|Balton]], experiencing some delay passing into and out of the 300' deep gorge carved through its heart by the river Dordon. When they leave [[Places-of-Asterion#Balton|Balton]]'s surrounding farmland, the woods beyond quickly grow dark and ominous. They camp for the night at the edge of the forest, on a ford on the river Lot, hearing some howling of wolves from the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] ahead. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] steadies [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']] from joining in with the chorus.

## Night Attack
They proceed across the river the next day, and begin to ascend into the hills, camping that night by a lone tree amid the highland scrub. After midnight, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] hear rustling in the brush, they climb the tree and ready their bows, alerting their comrades, who also prepare for an attack. The aggressors seem to spread out to surround the camp, and with the moon at a waning sliver, and sky cloudy, only [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] can actually see the threat, though [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] also senses it... somehow...

A ring of 8 very large wolves cautiously emerges from the brush, stalking slowly forward. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] thinks them probably wargs, the dire wolves often companions of goblins. She notes that they seem to move oddly, rocking and lolling their heads, seemingly sniffing intensively though she would expect them to be able to see their prey by now. She looses an arrow, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] fires his crossbow, the former wounding her target and the latter killing it outright. The remaining wargs charge into attack, though [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']] lunges forward attempting to preempt their attack. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] magically creates a wider campfire to help screen the party, but the remaining adventurers are soon locked in melee. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] steps forward from the tree, trying to see targets for his magic, but soon finds himself in the jaws of a pair of wargs. Fortunately, the warriors and archers are soon felling the beasts rapidly, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin]]'s jaws finishing two of them.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] inspect the carcasses, finding that all of the wargs seem to lack eyes, with healed wounds indicating that they were gouged out years before. The group considers the possibility that, particularly in the absence of goblins, these wargs may actually be minions of [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakeńdrixris]].

At dawn on Tuesday the 26th, the adventurers track the wolves forward, and begin to see signs of stony trees, along a path that leads into a hollow with a scattering of hovels. At its center there sits a dilapidated stone church. A figure is briefly visible in the steeple, but can't be readily identified, and all is eerily still thereafter as the heroes plan their approach.

*As the companions gazed upon the hollow with its scatter of stone-surrounded hovels, they couldn't shake the feeling they were being watched. Whatever lurked in that ancient church might hold the key to finding [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]] - but at what cost? The blind wargs had been just the first sign that the gorgon's influence stretched far beyond the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]] itself.*
