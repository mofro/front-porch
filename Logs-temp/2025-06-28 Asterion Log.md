# 2025-06-28 Asterion Log
*Original Date: June 28, 2025*
*Session Eighteen: On the Path of Retribution*

## Summary
Following the ley line of vengeance into the cave system, the companions face five massive trolls in a desperate battle by the tiered waterfalls. After defeating the trolls and a subsequent goblin assault, they explore deeper into the complex, discovering what appears to be a mine entrance and a goblin encampment. The ancient alabaster statues suggest this location holds significance to their quest, possibly connected to [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina's]] transformative experience in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]].

## Chapter 19 – On the Path of Retribution

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] feels out the edges of the mysterious object, noting its deeply pocketed surface, slimy coating of algae, and substantial mass for its size. As he tries to shift it on the lake bottom, he becomes aware of a prickling sensation on his hands, and a growing numbness and weakness spreading from them. He ultimately casts a Frostbite spell, which alleviates the discomfort and generates a mass of ice on his arms from which he breaks free with some difficulty.

He returns to shore and describes his experience. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] notes seeing an object floating over the center of the lake, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] walks on water to recover it, identifying it as a hazardous, but not especially unusual, flesh-eating ooze that was easily dispatched by the frost attack. But the group remains puzzled why [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] didn't persist after dealing with the threat to recover the magical object. Persuaded, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] retraces his steps on the lake bottom. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] uses his mysterious senses to see through the water, and notes that while the lake contains a thicket of sunken trees and branches, and a couple of rotten boats, there appears to be no sign of a village at all. Nevertheless, after a bit of groping in the murk, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] slowly trudges back to shore with a gnarled 100lb mass of enchanted iron that seems to function as a 27 point Powerstone.

After brief discussion, the adventurers resolve to follow the magical "Ley Line" to [[Places-of-Asterion#Mount Orpheus|Mount Orpheus]], investigating the alleged site of "goblins?" and "dragon?" enroute. They camp early in the woods by the [[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|"Devil's Seat"]] to catch up on missed rest, and head north following highland trails on the morning of Wednesday, the 10th. In the late morning they spy a large creature in flight up ahead, which [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] discerns as having bat-like wings, making leisurely arcs but ultimately keeping many miles away.

By late afternoon the trail has climbed up into a new range of hills, and begun to follow a deep gorge. As the sun grows low, the adventurers can see a rope bridge spanning the gorge from a cave in the mountainside, and considers whether to explore it, or alter their course to avoid it. They deviate from the trail, aiming to give the bridge a wide berth, but become aware of a scouting party of five warg-mounted goblins. They conceal themselves among rocks, but the goblins seem to note, by scent or sound, the presence of [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and charge him.

## The Ancient Gallery

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] is just as happy to stand his ground against the attack, rather than shrink from hated goblins, and he and his comrades are able to loose a volley of arrows, axes, and a bolt of lightning as the savages close. The goblins have no chance to reconsider before melee is joined, and they and their mounts are swiftly slaughtered, and ears collected.

The heroes pause to heal wounds and consider whether the noise of the clash was noted by other goblins. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], however, has grown mildly obsessed with the yawning depth of the gorge – perhaps the highest precipice she can recall seeing – and resolves to walk the suspension cable. Noting that the magical "path" they're tracing corresponds more closely to the bridge and cave than to the path they've been following, they resolve to support her reconnaissance.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] mounts one of the cables and scampers along it into the cave mouth, seeing no activity, but noting that the cave is lined with weathered alabaster statues of androgynous, vaguely elf-featured figures, each about 10-12' tall. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] cross the bridge in more conventional fashion pretty close behind her, followed by the rest of the group (though [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']], [[Dramatis-Personae#Bobby the Burro|Bobby the burro]], and the cart are left at a concealed bivouac just off the trail). None in the party can closely identify the style or subjects of the statuary, though they give the impression of noble figures, whatever their specific race or history.

The adventurers descend cautiously into the dark -- [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] at the lead, less inconvenienced by the dark, while the rest hang back, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] with a torch in hand. They count 26 statues as they advance, with minimal signs of life other than bats and bugs, though the stench of goblins and wargs is heavy in the air for those attuned to such things.

About 100 yards in, the cave passage opens into a vertical shaft, stretching up and down into darkness. Another suspension bridge spans this shaft, and the sound of rushing, falling water echoes through it. A heavy crusting of guano on the bridge indicates an even heavier population of bats above.

The chamber across the bridge is about 50 yards deep, with water flowing down a series of tiered pools on either side. At the bottom water trickles onto the chamber floor, converging into a stream that precipitates into the abyss. A few stools, buckets, and simple tools lay strewn randomly about.


Directly across from the bridge, a reinforced tunnel, suggestive of a mine, stretches on still further. The air at its mouth smells strongly of rock and metal and wargs.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] shapes the earth around the tunnel into a wall of rock a couple feet thick to seal off any threats while the adventurers plan what or whether to explore further – They consider a tunnel sloping upward, the apparent source of the waterfall on their right, or a path that leads down, winding around the inner surface of the shaft they first crossed. Before they settle on a course of action, however, they hear loud splashing from the waterfall tunnel. Readying for action, they are nonetheless shocked to see five nine-foot Trolls striding down the tiered falls to attack.

The heroes join battle, but are hard pressed for a time by the speed and ferocity of the Trolls' claws, and particularly by their resilience and regenerative ability – The beasts seem only mildly inconvenienced by fearsome blows, and even the loss of limbs. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus']] acid inhibits the regeneration, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] manages to ignite one troll's fur, but the fight wears on. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] shifts to a defensive posture, lacking a strong attack against such huge foes, but he is well able to draw one troll out of the fight while evading its attacks. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira's]] hammer proves more effective against them, and his diminutive size makes him a difficult target. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|Ferguson MacJayne]]'s]] blows are as fearsome as always, but even lopping off a Troll's head doesn't much slow its attacks. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], focusing on blinding shots, moves in to turn a loose troll head away from the fight, inhibiting its ability to coordinate attacks.

Finally, their cumulative attacks seem to get ahead of their foes' regeneration and all the Trolls are felled. But the adventurers barely get a chance to catch their breath before a mob of goblins surges up from the downward path.

## The Goblin Encampment

{{ ... }}

After a short rest, they descend cautiously down the winding path that had produced the goblin attack. About fifty feet down, they see the path opening onto a broader cavern lit by scattered torches. Within, they can make out at least a dozen goblins and several wargs in what appears to be a bivouac area. The wargs seem to be tracking their scent, and alerting their handlers to the intruders' presence.

Weighing their options, the companions decide that a direct assault on a prepared goblin camp would risk casualties they can ill afford, especially given the unknown extent of the cave system and the potential for more trolls or other threats. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] once again uses his earth-shaping magic to seal the passage with a stone plug, cutting off the goblins' access to their position.

## Theories and Reflections

The group returns to the chamber at the base of the tiered waterfall pools to consider their options. The sealed mine entrance ahead remains their most promising avenue of exploration, though the tunnel sloping upward to the waterfall source is also of interest. Given their exhaustion from the troll and goblin battles, they decide to rest before proceeding with either option.

As they discuss their plans, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] notes that the magical "ley line" they've been following from the [[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|Devil's Chair]] appears to pass through this cave system, suggesting it may hold significance to their quest. The possibility that the mine might lead to a dragon's lair – perhaps even the legendary [[Dramatis-Personae#Vestathrix|Vestathrix]] – is both exciting and terrifying.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] speculates that if [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] had her transformative experience somewhere in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]], this cave system with its ancient statues and strange energies could be connected to that event. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] suggests that the alabaster statues may represent ancient elven ancestors or deities, possibly indicating this was once a sacred site.

The companions set watches and rest as best they can in the stone chamber, surrounded by the constant sound of rushing water and the lingering smell of troll blood. They decide that when rested, they will unseal the mine entrance and continue their exploration, hoping to find answers to the mysteries that have drawn them deep into the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]].

*As the companions rested in the stone chamber, the constant rush of water from the tiered pools provided an eerie backdrop to their plans. The sealed mine entrance awaited them, potentially leading deeper into the mysteries of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]]. Whatever lay beyond—whether dragon, treasure, or revelations about [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina's]] transformation—would surely test their resolve and combat prowess yet again. The magical ley line of vengeance they'd been following seemed to be drawing them inexorably forward, into depths few had explored and lived to tell the tale.*
