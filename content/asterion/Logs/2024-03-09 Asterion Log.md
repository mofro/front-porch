# 2024-03 Asterion Log
*Original Date: March 9, 2024*
*Session One: The Chronicle of Companions - A Prelude to Adventure*

## Summary
The tale begins in the Kingdom of [[Places-of-Asterion#Great Keep|Great Keep]] in 1216 Anno Domini, where our unlikely fellowship first meets on [[Places-of-Asterion#Falcon Hill|Falcon Hill]] outside [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]]. A chance encounter at the gibbet leads to violence, negotiation, and the formation of bonds that will define their journey.

## The Meeting at Falcon Hill
On the windswept knoll where criminals dangle from the gibbet, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|Ferguson MacJayne]], a towering barbarian from the northern highlands, witnesses [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], an elven rogue, attempting to extract a key from the corpse of "[[Dramatis-Personae#Lucky Pete|Lucky Pete]]," a hanged thief. When a guard interrupts her grim task, MacJayne intervenes with brutal efficiency—his massive [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Ferguson MacJayne's Claymore|claymore]] separating the guard from both duty and head in a single stroke.

The [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Lucky Pete's Key|key]] is eventually retrieved after Jos negotiates with a ghoul in the bone pit beneath the gibbet, trading three fresh corpses (including the freshly slain guard) for her prize.

## The Skull & Sword Tavern
Jos enlists MacJayne as escort to the notorious [[Places-of-Asterion#Skull & Sword Tavern|Skull & Sword Tavern]] on [[Places-of-Asterion#Glatney Street|Glatney Street]], a den of thieves and cutthroats in Lutetia's shadowed quarters. A case of mistaken identity leads Jos to approach the wrong pair: [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], a mysterious blind elf with uncanny senses, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], a dwarven warrior whose [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Ahira's Warhammer|Warhammer]] has tasted many foes' blood.

When the actual targets—gang boss [[Dramatis-Personae#Hanmer|Hanmer]] and his halfling lieutenant [[Dramatis-Personae#Stoat|Stoat]]—arrive, treachery unfolds. Hanmer reveals his grudge against Jos's mentor [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]] and leads her to a cellar with unwelcoming intentions.

## Violence and Revelations
MacJayne, Vidocq, and Ahira sense betrayal and follow. The confrontation is swift and decisive:
- Stoat's neck is broken in MacJayne's massive grip
- Hanmer finds himself at knife-point, bargaining for his life with tales of "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Aramaina's Treasure|Aramaina's Treasure]]" and mentions of a mysterious scout named [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]]

## The Rescue
During negotiations, the companions discover [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus Thatch]]—scholar, mage, and Hanmer's captive—locked in a cask awaiting an unpleasant fate. His familiar, [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] the water nymph, emerges from hiding to greet her master's rescuers.

## The Final Member
As the newly formed party prepares to depart, angry patrons loyal to Hanmer block their path. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], a flamboyant minstrel, makes his entrance, using his [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Alvion's Hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdy]] to distract the mob while MacJayne's blade clears their escape route.

## The Fellowship Complete
Thus the companions are gathered:
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|Ferguson MacJayne]]**: Highland barbarian of simple directness and devastating strength
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]**: Elven rogue whose arrows fly true and daggers find their mark in darkness  
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]**: Blind seer whose perception transcends ordinary sight
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]**: Dwarven warrior, steadfast as his mountain ancestors
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus Thatch]]**: Scholar-mage with arcane knowledge concealing unexpected depths
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]**: Minstrel whose music charms both friend and foe
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]]**: Capricious water nymph, bound to [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] through ancient mysteries

## Mysteries Inherited
As they slip away into Lutetia's midnight streets, the companions carry several riddles:
- A key to a mysterious door
- Rumors of [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]], a poacher-turned-mercenary who betrayed an elven queen
- Whispers of [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Aramaina's Treasure|Aramaina's Treasure]], something beyond mortal reckoning

Little do they know their chance meeting will lead them into ancient tombs, against necromantic horrors, through conflicts with agents of darkness, and ultimately into the shadow of the legendary [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]]—an artifact whose mere mention causes the wise to tremble and the foolish to covet.
