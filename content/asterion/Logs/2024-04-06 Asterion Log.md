# 2024-04 Asterion Log
*Original Date: April 6, 2024*
*Session Two: The Gathering of Heroes*

## Summary
In the year 1226, with [[Dramatis-Personae#King Ludovic|King Ludovic]] of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] captured on crusade in the east, fortune's wheel brings together an unlikely band of companions whose deeds will soon echo throughout the realm. This retelling provides additional details of their fateful meeting and first adventure.

## The Highland Warrior's Quest
[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|Ferguson MacJayne]], the copper-haired barbarian from the northern highlands, had ventured south to Gallia seeking fortune—though precisely how much might satisfy him remained unclear even to himself. His massive frame, rippling muscles beneath tartan cloth, and the great [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Ferguson MacJayne's Claymore|claymore]] strapped across his back marked him as a warrior of uncommon prowess.

## The Gibbet Encounter Revisited

Jos delivered a chilling warning: should any harm befall her mentor [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]], she would return to extract a price in blood.

## The Scholar's Liberation
Thumping and muffled cries from a sealed cask revealed [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] Thatch]], a scholar and magic-user whose overdue debts had earned him confinement and a future as dog-training fodder. The mage, with rumpled robes and ink-stained fingers, introduced his unusual familiar—[[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]], a sprightly water nymph dwelling within a specially prepared waterskin at his hip.

## The Minstrel's Intervention
As the growing band prepared to exit, they found their path blocked by a menacing crowd of patrons loyal to Hanmer. Violence seemed inevitable when [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], the tavern's flamboyantly attired entertainer, intervened. His [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Alvion's Hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdy]] produced notes of such enchanting quality that the mob's attention was diverted long enough for the heroes to slip away into the night.

## The Fellowship Forged
Six souls whose paths were never meant to cross found themselves bound by circumstance:
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|Ferguson MacJayne]]**: The barbarian, his claymore thirsting for glory
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]**: The elven rogue, her arrows as swift as her wit  
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]**: The blind seer, whose other senses rendered meaningless
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]**: The dwarven warrior, solid as stone
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] Thatch]]**: The scholar-mage with his watery companion [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]]
- **[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]**: The minstrel whose music could soothe savage hearts

## The Key's Promise
Little did they know that the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Lucky Pete's Key|key]] taken from Lucky Pete's gullet would unlock not merely a door to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Great Keep|Great Keep]]'s lower levels, but the first of many adventures that would test their mettle and forge them into something greater than the sum of their parts—heroes whose names would echo throughout [[Places-of-Asterion#Asterion|Asterion]].

{{ ... }}
The session establishes several key elements:
- The [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]] as a legendary artifact of immense power
- [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]]'s betrayal of the Elf Queen as a central mystery
- The beginning of adventures that will span the breadth of Gallia
- References to ancient tombs and necromantic horrors yet to come

## Related Events

- Sets up the [[Places-of-Asterion#Great Keep|Great Keep]] exploration arc
- Establishes the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Aramaina's Treasure|Aramaina's Treasure]] quest line foundation
