# 2024-05 Asterion Log
*Original Date: May 10, 2024*
*Session Three: On The Road*

## Summary
The companions depart [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]] following the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Volcian Property Deed|Volcian Property Deed]] discovered in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Great Keep|Great Keep]]'s depths, seeking the "alleged [[Places-of-Asterion#Carnute Tomb|Carnute Tomb]]" near [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]]. Their journey leads through encounters with traveling entertainers and into the ancient burial chambers where they face guardians both spectral and material, uncovering treasures and mysteries that hint at darker secrets yet to be revealed.

## Chapter 4 – On The Road

The adventurers prepare for their journey as [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] secures torches, a lantern, and oil. She further organizes the group to steal a cart for [[Dramatis-Personae#Bobby the Burro|Bobby the Burro]], picking out the most abrasive vendor for her karmic sanction as the plaza nears closing. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] trips passing by, shattering a large urn, and amid the argument, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] tows away the cart. Hitching up the donkey, the gang leaves town before the gates close for the night, and regroups at the Red Mallet Inn in the suburban village of St. Marc's Chapel.

Rumor in the tavern that night has it that King Ludovic has been captured on crusade in Aegypt, along with his brothers Alford and Carl, in a stunning reversal of apparent earlier triumphs there. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] traces further rumors of the alleged necromancer, but can parse out little of use. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] defrays the group's expenses playing his [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Alvion's Hurdy-gurdy|Hurdy-Gurdy]].

The next day, the group proceeds uneventfully down the old Volcian paved road out of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]]. They pass through the forests of [[Places-of-Asterion#Clearwater Forest|Clearwater]], before turning onto a more southerly dirt road to the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Stamp|Stamp]] to spend the night, with no additional news. The following day they proceed through more farmland to the small village of [[Places-of-Asterion#Tori|Tori]].

### The Encounter with Nierynwen

[[Places-of-Asterion#Tori|Tori]]'s inn is somewhat busier than the previous stops on the trip, being the only one in town. Well after sundown, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] notes a "goaty" smell from a patron near the bar. While his legs are concealed by a long coat, she suspects that he might be a satyr. He quickly departs, but is followed by a handful of equally suspiciously-dressed humans who disperse around the room. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] decides to step outside, anticipating trouble, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] decides to take to the rafters as the patrons turn their attention to the door.

The distraction is a striking elf woman who enters flamboyantly, but gracefully, clad in deep blue and black satin embroidered in silver and gold thread. Her hip-length ebony curls cover half her alabaster face, while her visible, strikingly pale, blue eye sweeps the patrons. She perches on the side of the room's central firepit and directs her attendant, a blonde boy of perhaps eight years, to the bar, where he presents a crystal flute to the innkeeper to fill with some select potable.

With the assistance of [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] identifies the elf as [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen Malbrinryl]], a notorious bandit who apparently claims to be the daughter of the late elf queen [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] – [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] recalls that the previous King of the Elves of the Armorica Forest, [[Dramatis-Personae#Lydaer Elentaurae|Lydaer Elentaurae]], had been unrequitedly enamored of the young [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]], who served in his personal guard. About 400 years ago, [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] had married a much older High Elf by the name of [[Dramatis-Personae#Indólion Malbrinryl|Indólion Malbrinryl]]. Whatever his private feelings, Lydaer had publicly welcomed Indólion to the kingdom, granting him the title of Count of Ys as a dowry for [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]].

[[Dramatis-Personae#Indólion Malbrinryl|Indólion]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] soon bore a daughter, chiefly raised by her father, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s duties frequently took her far from home. About 300 years ago, [[Dramatis-Personae#Indólion Malbrinryl|Indólion]] and the daughter had mysteriously vanished, foul play being suspected, but no suspects identified. [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] had resigned her post, and gone "journeying" in despair. She was not reliably heard from for some 250 years, when King Lydaer passed away, without acknowledged issue, and surprised the realm by bequeathing his kingdom to [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]. Returning to claim the bequest, and wearing the legendary [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] claimed to have had visions on her journey, warning her of the imminent threat of humans to Mother Earth itself, and proceeded to raise an army to war on the surrounding human kingdoms.

While [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]'s career as a bandit – her outlawry and bounties on her head – apparently date back over 100 years, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] notes it's not clear that she was claiming to be the missing daughter before [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s death a little over 20 years ago.

Through her serving boy, [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] summons [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] (his curiosity aroused by the elf's wreath of perfume, and already eavesdropping on her velvet-whispered directives) to the fire pit to share drink and conversation. He chats cautiously, noting the rumors of King Ludovic's capture, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] notes wryly that kings come and go so frequently in her perception. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] chimes in across the hushed room that queens do as well, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] responds only with a fleeting smirk to the provocation, pressing [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] for tales of his travels.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] explains that the group is laying low after tangling with a gang doing business with "[[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]", telling a bit about their rescue of the beggars, [[Dramatis-Personae#Andre|Andre]]'s tale of the Breakers' lair in the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]], and their intent to one day track them there and end them. [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] seems aware of the Breakers' presence in the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]], expressing at least some disdain for their "petty cruelties". A mildly intoxicated [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] punctuates his own contempt by banging his head against his table, which elicits a wince from [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]], but she again shrugs off any attempted provocation.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] takes over relating her own tales, telling how she and her outlaws have preyed on the revenues of the King and Church. She stands to punctuate, with exuberant dance and sweeps of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Urumi|Urumi]] she draws from her waist, her description of a confrontation with a powerful knight who succumbed to her envenomed blade. As her hair theatrically billows, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] glimpse that the way it draped at rest had concealed a black satin eyepatch.

While most of the patrons in the inn are spellbound by the display, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] notes some additional apparent elf bandits arriving out of the dark, and something airborne buzzes about. A hirsute figure, who [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] thinks may be a Woodwose, passes a message to another bandit who enters to whisper to [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]. She leads her band in a quick departure, but takes time to express her wish to [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] that they might see each other again before long.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], who has been observing the action, apparently unseen, slips out the open roof in pursuit of the bandits, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] are not far behind, but another gang member has apparently been attending horses, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]]'s entourage mounts up and departs to the south. Quickly outpaced, the adventurers break off as the buzzing flier passes through them, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] by now guessing that it might be a pixie. As the group reaches the inn, they are confronted by a group of mounted troops of the King's Guard, but deny any knowledge of the bandits, and are soon left behind.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] relates her fear that [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] and her gang are seeking the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]], and emphasizes that they must be stopped, and the armor destroyed. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] objects that surely such powerful armor would be worth keeping. But [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] does not argue further.

As the adventurers head south the next day, they note the tracks of the bandits' path, and that they seem to have veered east off the road only a couple miles south of [[Places-of-Asterion#Tori|Tori]]. The group proceeds uneventfully to [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]], and checks into another inn. Here, alongside more breathless speculation about the captured King Ludovic, there is some talk of unusual, out-of-season flooding near the Solon Marshes south of the city. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] also overhears talk of a group of wagons, possibly some sort of performing troupe, heading east from the road down which his party had just come – considered unusual because their path didn't seem to be toward any major city such as one would expect such a group to favor.

## Chapter 5 – Into the Tomb

The next morning, Friday the 13th, the adventurers cross the long bridge over the river [[Places-of-Asterion#Liger River|Liger]], and see a standing stone circle atop a hill to the south. Visiting it, they note that the hill is riddled with small excavations, seemingly dating back decades or more. This is not, however, the circle noted in the deed, which lies a bit further from the river, to the west of here. It appears that a stretch of woods has grown in the centuries since the deed was written, and the group traces a path around them to avoid suspicious game wardens.

Near their apparent objective, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] takes to the trees, and identifies an eroded hillside and cluster of toppled, formerly standing, stones. Noting a gap in the piled stones, she and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] worm their way into a low-ceilinged stone chamber, lined with swirling carvings, with a large, similarly decorated stone block at its center. The pair rub some of the patterns onto parchment for potential examination by the [[Dramatis-Personae#Professore Miguel de Patavium|Professore]] back in [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]], though [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] finds that the patterns begin to make him nauseated after awhile.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] is called in to attempt to move the stone block, and manages to hurt himself pinching fingers and toes against the floor and ceiling. He does discover that the block is not a sarcophagus, but rather the seal to a stairway down into the earth, which the Highland Hero wrestles aside after nursing his blood blisters. The group forms up to descend, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] magically adjusts the rubble of the entrance to conceal their activities from any passers by.

The walls of the stairwell are lined with illegibly deteriorated murals, and its stairs scattered with rotten bird feathers. A horribly rusted pot helmet lies at the foot of them. A small chamber to the right is strewn with broken potsherds and bits of rotten wood. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] picks up a small, lidded box of soapstone painted with unrecognizable glyphs, and a small, gilded wooden cage containing a scattering of feathers and bones. At the end of the stairs is a granite slab, carved with likewise indecipherable figures, with a pair of bronze bolts at the sides, held down with lead seals. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] again answers the call, breaks off the seals, and pushes the middle of the door to no effect. Shifting to the right, he finds that it pivots, allowing the group to enter.

### The Chamber of Statues

The chamber within was once adorned with deteriorated murals like the stairwell, but is still dominated by a pair of 9' statues of red-violet porphyry – To the left a fearsome-looking warrior with fangs and claws, clad in feathers, furs, and leather armor, and on the right a statue of a woman in clingy robes, posed as if dancing, from which the head appears to have been removed. Further to the right, an arched passageway stretches into the dark, and traces in the dirt and debris on the floor indicate that something was dragged along the floor that way at some point in the past.

The group slowly advances, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] at the fore, until a menacing growl resounds down the passage. Suddenly a massive, decayed-looking black dog, perhaps 5' at the shoulder, barrels down the hall. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] dodges its charge, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] deflects it with his shield. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] thrusts his claymore with both hands into the beast's side, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] looses an arrow into its eye, and it suddenly vanishes in an explosion of ashes.

Continuing down the hall, the group finds a plain side chamber carved from the rock, containing nothing but a puddle of reeking water, a seeming bed of flattened straw, and many scattered humanoid bones. They continue down the hall and down a small flight of stairs to a high ceilinged chamber with a buckled corner. They decide first to search the smaller of the two corridors departing it, and follow it to a small chamber with a floor littered with rotten twigs, parchment, and broken glass. A small table stands in one corner of the room, and a brass candelabrum in another. In the middle of the room sits a large oaken trunk, apparently atop a pentacle chalked on the floor. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] at first hangs back covering the larger passageway, but joins the rest as they debate how to proceed, and complicates the issue by sensing precious metal in the trunk.

### The Shadow in the Trunk

Another chilling growl tables the discussion as the black dog reappears at the entrance to the side chamber, and charges toward the group. They answer with all the firepower they can muster. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] fires his crossbow, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] deploys a spearhead from his staff and hurls it to strike the beast's eye, [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] charges with his guisarme, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] lands another arrow in its other eye – again it vanishes, raining ash on [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], who was its apparent target.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] return to the side chamber, finding nothing unchanged from their previous visit. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] uses his earth-shaping magic again, sealing the chamber with a 2' thick plug of stone, and the group deliberates on how to proceed.

After considering numerous proposals, the group decides the trunk can wait until they explore the other corridor of the tomb. They head back and turn north, spotting a pair of silver coins lying about 15' apart, the last lying just a few feet from the corridor's terminus – a pair of bronze doors, with traces of a broken lead seal on the seam between them. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] noisily pulls one open, and the adventurers peer in.

The doors open to a room about 30' wide by 25' feet deep, walls covered with mostly obliterated frescos similar to those elsewhere in the tomb. To the right is a charred and scorched patch on the floor perhaps 8' across, strewn with blackened bones. Across the room from the door are two steps up to a dais on which rests a large stone sarcophagus, the lid of which apparently rests behind it. A pair of winged demon-like statues stand to either side of it.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] slips in the door and moves left, clear of the charred area, while looking up for a possible threat that might have caused it. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] slips in less cautiously, bent on examining the bones more closely. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] soon finds the floor beneath his feet to be unstable, an 8' square of the stone apparently pivoting in the middle over some sort of pit, but freezes and manages to keep his balance. The rest of the group filing in behind to the center of the room, but soon distracted by the two stone gargoyles taking wing to attack.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] leaps to defend [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] with his guisarme. He deflects a weighted chain hurled at the mage's head, It entangles his weapon, but in the ensuing tug of war he pulls the chain from the gargoyle's grasp, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] hits it with an arrow. The second gargoyle rushes [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], but fails with its chain attack as the dwarf backpedals to safety off the pit lid, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] steps up to remove the gargoyle's head with a single blow.

The first gargoyle attacks [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] with teeth and claws, but misses. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] strikes it with another arrow, but this one fails to even penetrate its stony hide. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], however, has had time to prepare a spell, and spews acid that melts its head to a nub as its snarling gurgles to silence, and it drops lifeless to the floor.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] wrestles the pit lid to a halt after his slain gargoyle falls into it. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] descends to find only an iron spike at the pit's bottom. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] search the sarcophagus, finding only a headless, mummified corpse and a few scattered ounces of myrrh. The adventurers adjourn to the far corner of the tomb to reinvestigate the trunk.

After renewed discussion, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] carefully enters the circle, unlatches the container, and opens the lid to see only pitch darkness. She flinches and dodges as the darkness appears to reach out to touch her. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] thrusts his guisarme at the dark mass, only to have it snatched from his grasp and flung back at him, inflicting a nasty gash to his midriff. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] bounds out of the circle to safety, and the lid lies open for a bit, showing only darkness, before slamming shut.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] proposes that whatever is in the trunk is now trying to hide, and suggests some sort of peaceful resolution. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] theorizes that the dark shape is some form of [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Shadow Demon|demon]], though he can't provide any more specifics, and the group soon settles once again on a brute force solution to the quandary.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] gingerly steps into the circle and reopens the lid. A shadowy form attempts to grapple with him, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] hits it with an arrow to no apparent effect. Finally a mighty blow from [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s sword disperses the shadow in a puff of black vapor, and the trunk lies empty.

### The Treasure Trove

The adventurers search the trunk, finding a considerable treasure hoard:
- 1,292 copper pieces
- 148 silver dollars  
- 33 gold pieces
- A 12oz. [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Silver Flask|Silver Flask]] of perfumed oil
- A simple silver ring
- A silver-coated, fine quality [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Bladed Hand|Bladed Hand]]
- A small ceramic jar gilded with complex geometric patterns and containing 6oz. of [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Opium|Opium]]
- An accordion-folded papyrus primer in Elvish for the Necromantic spell [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Sense Spirit|Sense Spirit]]

Uncertain how to proceed, the group decides to withdraw from the tomb. They return to [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]], but hesitate to sell any goods there lest they arouse suspicion about their probably illegal activities on noble land. Rooming at an inn overnight, they proceed back to [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]].
