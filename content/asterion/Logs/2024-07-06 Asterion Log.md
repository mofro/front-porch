# 2024-07 Asterion Log
*Original Date: July 6, 2024*
*Session Five: Assault on the Fortress*

## Summary
Having learned the location of the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' fortress in the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]], the companions mount a direct assault on the stronghold. Approaching through dense forest, they engage the fortress's outer defenses, facing guards and discovering evidence of the evil operations within. The battle tests their resolve as they push deeper into enemy territory.

## Chapter 7 â€“ Into the High Fens

Following their departure from [[Places-of-Asterion#Wassford|Wassford]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]]'s intelligence about the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' stronghold, the companions make their way into the rugged wilderness of the [[Places-of-Asterion#High Fens|High Fens]]. The journey takes them through increasingly hostile terrain - dense woods, boggy marshes, and volcanic hot springs that make the region uniquely inhospitable.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] leads the way, his dwarven knowledge of underground passages and mountain terrain proving invaluable as they navigate the treacherous paths. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], despite his blindness, proves equally adept at sensing danger ahead, his other senses heightened to preternatural levels.

The party travels cautiously, aware that these lands are nominally divided between various counts and prince-bishoprics, but in reality remain lawless wilderness. The presence of lizard men tribes and their dragon-god makes any territorial claims largely theoretical.

After several days of careful travel, they approach [[Places-of-Asterion#Rockfort|Rockfort]] - the last civilized settlement before entering the true wilderness. The town sits on the edge of the Fens, its Cistercian abbey and parish church providing a final bastion of order before the chaos beyond.

## The Fortress Revealed

Beyond Rockfort, [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]]'s directions lead them to an abandoned fortification - an old stockade that once served as a trading post but now serves far darker purposes. The structure sits in a clearing carved from the dense forest, its wooden walls showing signs of hasty but effective repair.

From their concealed position in the tree line, the companions observe the fortress. Guards patrol the walls at irregular intervals - not professional soldiers, but hardened criminals and worse. The main gate appears to be the only obvious entrance, though [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] notes that such structures often have hidden exits or underground passages.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] uses his magic to scout the area more thoroughly, detecting traces of dark enchantments around the compound. The magical signature suggests involvement with entities from below - perhaps explaining the presence of the orc shaman [[Dramatis-Personae#Colthan|Colthan]] had mentioned.

The group debates their approach. A direct assault risks alerting everyone inside, but stealth may be impossible given [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s considerable size and [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]]'s inexperience with subterfuge. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] suggests splitting into two groups - one to create a distraction at the main gate while another infiltrates from an alternate direction.

## The Assault Begins

As twilight descends, the companions move into position. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] approach the main gate directly, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] circle to find another way in, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] accompanying [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s group.

The frontal group doesn't attempt stealth. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] strides toward the gate, his massive claymore visible over his shoulder, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] readies his crossbow. The guards spot them immediately, raising an alarm that echoes through the compound.

"Who goes there?" one guard shouts from the wall, reaching for a bell.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s crossbow bolt answers before the words fully leave the guard's mouth. The man crumples backward with a bolt through his throat, the alarm bell clattering uselessly beside him.

The gate swings open and more guards pour out - six rough-looking men armed with cudgels and short swords. They spread out, attempting to surround the three intruders, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] is already weaving his hands, speaking words of power. Lightning crackles from his fingertips, arcing between two of the attackers. They convulse and fall, smoke rising from their bodies.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] meets the charge of three more guards, his claymore sweeping in a wide arc that forces them back. The massive blade crashes into one man's hastily raised cudgel, splintering it and continuing through to cleave deeply into his shoulder. The man screams and falls.

## Infiltration

Meanwhile, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] has found what she was looking for - a section of wall where the repairs are newer and less sturdy. She scales it with practiced ease, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] following with surprising grace despite his blindness. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] helps [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] up last, the young dragon managing the climb with feline agility.

Inside the compound, chaos reigns as most defenders rush toward the main gate where the alarm came from. The infiltration team moves swiftly but carefully toward the main building - a larger structure that clearly serves as the headquarters for the operation.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] spots movement in a second-floor window and freezes, pulling the others into shadow. A figure peers out, scanning the courtyard, but doesn't spot them in the gathering darkness. When the figure turns away, they continue forward.

At the building's rear, they find a service entrance - less grand than the front but also less guarded. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] tests the door carefully, his sensitive touch detecting no traps on the handle. It opens with a soft creak.

Inside, they find themselves in what appears to be a storage area. Crates and barrels are stacked haphazardly, and in one corner, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] spots bolts of cloth - including what looks like the same spider silk they had tracked earlier. This confirms they're in the right place.

Voices echo from deeper in the building. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] signals for quiet as they move forward, navigating by the sound of the combat still raging outside.

## The Courtyard Battle

Back at the main gate, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and his group have pushed through the initial defenders and into the courtyard proper. More guards emerge from barracks buildings, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] notes with concern that some appear better armed and armored than common thugs.

"Mercenaries," he mutters, sending another bolt into the chest of an approaching soldier. "They've hired actual soldiers."

A crossbow bolt whizzes past [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s head - the enemy has archers on the walls. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] responds with another spell, this time calling forth a wall of flame that sweeps across the wooden walkway. Archers scatter or fall burning.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] engages two soldiers who work together with practiced coordination, their movements suggesting military training. His claymore rings against their blades in a deadly dance, but his superior reach and strength begin to tell. One soldier makes a desperate lunge that [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] sidesteps, bringing his blade around in a devastating riposte that nearly cuts the man in half.

The second soldier backs away, fear evident in his eyes. This isn't what he signed up for. He turns to run, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s crossbow catches him between the shoulder blades. He falls face-first into the dirt.

## Discovery

Inside the main building, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s group has found what they feared - a workshop where the horrific "child breaking" is performed. Tools designed to maim rather than kill are arranged on a table with clinical precision. Restraints are bolted to a heavy chair. The walls bear stains that speak to the room's grim purpose.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] turns away, looking ill. Even [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], who cannot see the details, can sense the evil that has been done here. [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] hisses softly, her dragon nature recognizing a fundamental wrongness in this place.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s face is set in hard lines as she methodically searches the room for evidence. They'll need proof to present to authorities - assuming any authority cares about the fate of orphaned children. She finds documents hidden in a desk drawer - correspondence between the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]] here and their contacts in various cities, including [[Places-of-Asterion#Lutetia|Lutetia]].

A floorboard creaks behind them. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] spins, his enhanced senses having caught the sound an instant before it occurred. A figure stands in the doorway - one of the better-dressed individuals they've seen here, clearly someone of importance in the organization.

"Well," the man says, his hand moving toward a weapon at his belt. "It seems we have uninvited guests."

## Confrontation

Before he can draw his blade, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s arrow takes him in the shoulder, spinning him around. He staggers but doesn't fall, revealing surprising resilience. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] is already moving, his blade singing from its sheath.

The fight is brief but vicious. The man is skilled, his sword work showing formal training, but he's facing three determined opponents in close quarters. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] strikes with his weapon while [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] engages directly. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] circles for another shot.

The man manages to parry [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s initial strike and riposte, drawing blood from the blind swordsman's arm. But [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]'s blade finds his side at the same moment [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] puts another arrow into his leg.

He goes down hard, the fight leaving him. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] stands over him, blade at his throat.

"The 'Maestro,'" [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] says quietly. "Where is he?"

The man's eyes widen. "Below," he gasps. "The caves below. But you'll neverâ€”"

He doesn't finish. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s blade slides home efficiently, ending the man's involvement in the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' evil.

## Regrouping

The sounds of combat from outside have diminished. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] moves to a window and signals to [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s group below. The courtyard is littered with bodies - the fortress's defenders have been routed or killed. A few may have escaped into the forest, but the stronghold itself is taken.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] join them inside. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] looks around the room, his expression darkening as he takes in its purpose.

"We burn this place," he says flatly. "To the ground."

"Not yet," [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] replies, holding up the documents she found. "There are caves below. And someone called the 'Maestro' is down there. We're not done here."

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] examines the floor, finding what they're looking for - a concealed trapdoor leading down. Ancient stone steps descend into darkness, worn smooth by countless feet over the years.

The group prepares themselves, healing their wounds and readying weapons and spells. Whatever awaits them below, they know it will be worse than what they've faced so far. The [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' operation goes deeper than simple cruelty - there are connections to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Underworld|Underworld]] itself.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] lights a torch, his darkvision supplemented by mundane light for the benefit of his companions. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] takes the lead, his massive frame filling the narrow passage. Behind him, the others follow in single file.

They descend into the earth, leaving the burning sunset behind. Whatever horrors the "Maestro" has created in these depths, they're determined to end them this night.

The stairs wind downward, deeper than any natural cave should go. The air grows cool and damp, carrying strange scents - sulfur from volcanic vents, the musty smell of underground water, and something else. Something wrong.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] pauses, his head tilted. "Something ahead," he whispers. "Something large. And something... other."

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] nods, sensing it too through his magical awareness. Dark energies permeate these tunnels, older than the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' recent occupation.

They continue forward, weapons ready, magic prepared. The passage opens into a larger chamber ahead, and they can hear movement within - multiple creatures, by the sound of it.

The battle for the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]]' fortress is won. But the fight to end their operations completely has only just begun.

*The flames from [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]'s spells still flickered in the courtyard above as the companions descended into darkness. They had dealt a blow to the [[Dramatis-Personae#Child Breakers|Child Breakers]], but [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] knew from bitter experience that evil like this had deep roots. The "Maestro" awaited below, and with him, answers to questions they hadn't yet thought to ask.*
