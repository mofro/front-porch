# 2024-08 Asterion Log
*Original Date: August 31, 2024*
*Session Seven: Circus Of The Dead*

## Summary
On their way to revisit the ancient tomb near [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]], the companions encounter a horrifying scene - the troupe of traveling performers they met earlier has been transformed into undead monstrosities by a [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|necromancer]]. After defeating the zombie menace and destroying its creator, they discover strange magical items including the mysterious "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Selfish Scribe|Selfish Scribe]]" that can write messages visible only to its user.

## Chapter 10 – Circus Of The Dead
[[Dramatis-Personae#Ursula the Dancing Bear|Ursula]] rears up her fly-blown bulk eye-to-eye with [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], who draws his mighty blade and lops off one of her paws. The bear is unfazed, however, and throws an arm around the highlander, biting at his throat. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], shocked by the sight and smell of the corpse-beast, falls hard into a swoon, knocking his head loudly against a rock, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] springs with his guisarme to [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s aid. The two manage to fell the bear as a group of zombie humans – men, women, and children, appears from between the wagons, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] moves to engage them.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], flanking the rest of the group, advance to the line of caravans, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] climbing one for a better vantage point. He at once senses a mass of activity in the woods framing the meadow, but his warning is quickly mooted by the emergence of many more zombies, including dogs, and some of the oxen that had been drawing the wagons, all advancing through and around the wagons. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] looses an arrow at one of the human zombies, but she and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] soon climb up wagons as well to avoid being encircled.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] wades into the zombie mob, fending off some with his shield while striking others with his pick. His customary blows to foes' vitals prove disappointing against the undead, so he shifts to striking at their heads, but still finds them slow to fall. Fending off the zombies' attempts to grapple, and with a dog latched onto his armored codpiece, he stands his ground, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] strikes over his head to lop off those of the persistent walking dead. As rotting oxen threaten their flanks, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] shifts his attention to them, efficiently crippling them by chopping off legs, but getting pierced by a horn or two for his trouble.

As zombies climb after them, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] make their way into the tree branches, still searching for the [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]] they presume to be controlling the horde. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] senses a small group of humanoid figures in the woods who are not currently charging, and singles out one as the apparent leader. He and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] continue to advance, uncertain of whether they've been seen, but a sudden thunderclap sounds, and an unseen force knocks the blind elf from his perch in the trees, and the wind from his lungs.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] attempts a leap from one caravan to another, and slips to the ground, but quickly recovers and scales the wagon again, pursued by a zombie. Spotting [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] still sprawled in the meadow with a little zombie girl heading for him, he attempts a healing spell song in hope of reviving the mage. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] does, in fact, stir from his blackout, the knot on the back of his head receded, but is sufficiently horrified by the sight of the little corpse approaching to go back into shock. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] vaults back into the fray to support [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and possibly [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], if he can be reached in time.

Three zombies, including the former [[Dramatis-Personae#Blossom the Baboon|Blossom the Baboon]], charge from their leader toward [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], as the elf shakes off the effects of the implosion loosed by the [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]]. He strikes back with an arrow that tears open his foe's cheek, but does not fell him. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] sprints along the branches to a vantage nearly above the [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]], and strikes him behind the collarbone with an arrow that finishes the job. The remaining mob of corpses topples to earth with a rolling sigh.

## The Necromancer's Tools
The heroes tend to their wounded, and search the dead. Mundane tools and household items fill most of the wagons. The [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]] still wears his cheaply made but flashy fortune-telling outfit -- a robe and turban studded with semi-precious stones. He bears a finely made, brass-hilted knife of meteoric iron that probably functioned as an atheme, as well as 3 sharp, 6" blade-like pieces of a hard, transparent gray glass-like substance, held in a bandolier-like strip of leather, and perhaps usable as throwing knives.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] lead a search for tracks through the woods, that uncovers some ancient simple rock structures, perhaps simple ruins of an old pagan temple or shrine. It appears that the [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]] had set up some sort of workspace, including a bound Latin alchemical formulary, a small, portable alchemical workshop, and a bundled set of chirugical (or perhaps mostly dissection) instruments.

Among the instruments is included a bronze probe or scribe with [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] recognize as magical, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] further identifies as a "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Selfish Scribe|Selfish Scribe]]" - a tool capable of scratching marks or writing which can only be seen by the one who inscribed it. While there are many foot tracks in the area, indicating substantial activity from the alchemist, the group is frustrated to find no notes explaining his intent, but the presence of the Scribe raises the possibility that other papers, or the ruins themselves, bear explanations that no living person can read.

There is also a selection of containers holding an assortment of apparent potions. Two earthenware flasks hold an inky black fluid that is likely the fatigue-restoring "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Paut Potions|paut]]" also found in the [[Dramatis-Personae#Maestro|Maestro]]'s lair, and two more hold a honey-gold liquid – likely healing potions. Several more remain mysterious, however: Another earthenware jar contains a cloudy gray, slightly fizzy, liquid. Three carved quartz vials contain clear oils, and three more thinner liquids – one yellowish and two clear, one of those having a dropping rod on its cap.

The adventurers return the meadow, collecting the various corpses, which [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] readily buries with a Move Earth spell. There is some more speculation about what motivates necromancers in the first place, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] offers that he has heard that while it probably varies, he has heard that necromancy itself can become addictive, with curious experimentation soon becoming self-justifying.

## Justice and Reward
Returning to [[Places-of-Asterion#Stamp|Stamp]], the group spends the night at an inn, the next day visiting the Sheriff to report their encounter and inquire about a reward for meting quick justice to the [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]]. They return to the meadow and uncover the remains to prove their tale. While the Sheriff is mildly apprehensive about [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]' magical feats, he seems relieved that the [[Dramatis-Personae#Necromancer|Necromancer]] is dead, and happy to send the adventurers on their way with a writ to certify their claim in [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]]. They arrive on Friday, June 10, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] redeem the writ for 50 gold Florins, worth fully $1,000.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], pursuing general information and networking, seeks an audience with Bishop Peter at the cathedral, but is received only by Monsignor Simon. Simon has apparently reviewed recent correspondence, and informs [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] that he has been excommunicated – [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] believes this to be for the heresy of trafficking with spirits – in the form of his familiar, [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]]. Simon is curious, but dispassionate in delivering the news, and explains that [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] will not be permitted to take communion or call upon other blessings of the church, pending his petition to a Bishop of the Church confessing his sin, and performance of appropriate penitence. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] is mildly annoyed by this development, but disinclined to pursue the matter, and returns to the group's inn for a festive evening.

## Chapter 11 – Return To The Tomb
On Saturday, the heroes recross the great bridge over the Liger, and return to the woods where the tomb remains undisturbed. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] unseals the entrance with another Move Earth, and they descend to the entry chamber, reexamining the statues of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Demon King Statue|Demon King]], and [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Headless Queen Statue|headless Queen]], testing whether either might be moved. They confirm that the chamber where the demon dog seemed to have originated remains sealed, and make their way back where the trunk still lies atop the chalk pentacle, searching for traces of the Queen's missing skull, but find nothing. Returning at last to the sarcophagus, they place some tinder and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] magically ignites it.

The remains quickly reduced to ash, the group returns once more to the entry chamber, where they are startled to find half of the wall to the left of the statues to be missing. In it's place, a rough, 10' wide, cavelike passage descends, with rough hewn stairs, into darkness.

*As the entrance to deeper chambers within the tomb yawned before them, a chill breeze whispered up from the darkness, carrying scents of ancient stone and forgotten secrets. Whatever lay below had been sealed away for centuries, waiting for someone to solve the riddle of the headless queen.*
