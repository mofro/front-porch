# 2024-09-21 Asterion Log
*Original Date: September 21, 2024*
*Session Eight: Return To The Tomb*

## Summary
The adventurers descend into the newly revealed deeper chambers of the ancient tomb, where they encounter more guardians and discover the final resting place of a [[Dramatis-Personae#Vampire Chief|vampire chief]]. After a harrowing battle against the undead lord and his skeletal warriors, they emerge with treasure beyond their wildest dreams, including a massive silver sarcophagus and numerous magical artifacts.

## Chapter 11 – Return To The Tomb (cont.)

The heroes cautiously descend the steep, uneven stairs 20' to where there is a heavy wooden door at the side of the passage. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] shoulders it open, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] leads the way in. His infravision can't distinguish a lot of detail in the cool, long undisturbed, chamber, but he determines that there are stairs midway through it, down 5' to a lower level, where a small wooden table sits by a 5' square shaft in the floor, filled with stagnant water. A heavy oaken mallet rests on the floor, leaning against the wall, and a moldy, deteriorated human skeleton lies in pieces on the dirt floor under the table. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] magically moves the water from the well/cistern, snaking it all the way up to the tomb entrance, where he disperses it. Finding nothing but a residue of mildew left behind, the group tosses table, bones, and mallet into the pit, and continues on its way.

The passage turns right, and another treacherous stairway down another 20' leads the group into a wider, even more cavelike passage, complete with stalactites and stalagmites, strewn with rocks, bones, and a 5' section of a fluted black marble column. They fan out to investigate the scene, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] idly examines a skull lying near the column. When he drops it, it oddly rolls and skitters a few feet to the side, as other bones gather beneath it, rising into a complete skeleton, holding a rusty rock chisel.

Bones throughout the chamber simultaneously rise at the same time, also wielding chisels or stone hammers, and charge the various members of the party.

The skeletons attack without much coordination, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] maintains his composure in the face of this undead onslaught. While new ones assemble from the scattered bones to replace those destroyed by the adventurers, few manage to land substantial blows, and the heroes effectively move to each other's aid. Perhaps a dozen and a half rise and fall, but only [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] takes a substantial hammer blow to the leg. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] heals it with a quick song as the group catches its breath after the skirmish, and they soon proceed down the passage again. It narrows and descends another 20' down rough stairs, before opening into a wider, finished marble hall.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], still leading the way, looks down the hall, noting the ominous apparent sarcophagae along the walls. He also sees another, smaller portal across the hall from where he entered, within which he notes promising glittering. He decides to explore that path first, and enters an irregularly shaped chamber roughly 20' x 30', painted with figures of barbaric warriors looting and pillaging villages. Against one wall stands a large, gilded and enameled funereal wagon, bearing a likewise gilded cauldron filled with bone fragments and stacked with painted and rune-inscribed skulls. Stacked beneath it are numerous rotted sacks and ceramic urns, a few intact, but mostly rifled by vermin. Across the chamber 7 dark, 4' x 3' x 1" slabs (roughly rectangular, but with oddly elongated corners, suggestive of the shape of an animal hide) lean against the wall. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] quickly identifies the slabs as copper, weighing about 55lbs each.

## The Secret Chamber

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] examines the trove at length, and is soon joined by the rest of the curious party in twos and threes. Before more than a couple have arrived, he has begun to look behind the copper, finding a crudely mortared section of the wall from which he can easily extract stone blocks. He pulls out a few, with the others' assistance, and discovers a chamber beyond. Peering in to find even more inviting glittering, the dwarf crawls in to investigate, but is suddenly grabbed and disappears from sight!

His assailant is the skeleton of a huge snake. Its fangs mercifully don't penetrate his armor, but its coils quickly envelop him and begin to constrict relentlessly. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] claws at the mortar, removing stone blocks as fast as he can to permit more compact and nimble members of the group to intervene. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] slip in to the small chamber, and repeatedly strike at the mass of bones entwining the dwarf. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] fires an arrow, but finds it penetrates the bones too readily, penetrating [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s helmet and almost his skull as well, but fortunately he shakes off the blow.

As [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] leans partway into the hole, preparing an acid jet, the ophidian skeleton at last crumbles under the combined assault and leaves [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] in a heap. The group's relief is short-lived, however, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] suddenly convulses from a heavy sword-blow to his back and withdraws from the hole to sprawl on the floor of the funeral chamber. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] feels a grave chill, like the blood draining from his body, and looks up to see a group of four human skeletons standing alongside the mage bearing swords and shields, and their bones intricately inscribed with runes.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] draws his sword once more to battle the skeletons, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] in turn dive back out the hole in the wall. Some feel the same "draining" that the Highlander does, though others have more success in resisting it. With better weapons, and bearing shields, these warrior skeletons prove a bit more resilient than the previous "laborers", but the heroes soon cleave arms and legs and shatter ribs. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] collects himself, and spits a gout of acid that reduces one to slurry. As the last of them falls, the draining chill relents, and the heroes pause to catch their breath once more.

The lids of the four sarcophagae along the walls of the main hall are found to be askew, and these were the apparent origin of the last wave of skeletons. The adventurers pause for more healing, and contemplate departing with what seems to be an already impressive load of loot, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] notes a final large sarcophagus lying on a raised plinth at the far end of the hall, surrounded by a pool of water. Its bas reliefs are dark with tarnish, but the dwarf clearly recognizes it as a mass of sliver, and the group resolves to complete their exploration.

## The Vampire Chief

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] releases [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] to examine the water in the pool, and finds that it has somewhat less mold and scum than expected, having apparently been scattered with silver powder some time in the distant past, most of which has settled lightly to the bottom. Having concluded from the apparent funerary precautions that the entombed Chief was probably some sort of vampire, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] searches his memory for possible vulnerabilities of such creatures. Recalling that vampires are sometimes said to have a weakness not only to silver, but to sacred or mystical woods, such as mistletoe or oak, he realizes that the mallet found in an earlier chamber might well be useful. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] returns to recover it, and hands it off to [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], while herself readying the silvered [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Bladed Hand|"bladed hand"]] weapon recovered on their earlier foray into the tomb. Finally, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] steps up the the side of the sarcophagus, and pries open the lid – hesitating, at first, to look inside, but realizing that someone has to...

The group is horrified, but not truly surprised, when the crypt's occupant rises, emitting a shrieking howl that stuns [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], and then lashes out with a clawed hand to grab him. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] directs a stream of water from the pool and the other heroes leap to assist, and land blows. The [[Dramatis-Personae#Vampire Chief|Vampire Chief]] does not seem to flinch at most of them, but the silver claws leave particularly wicked wounds, and he shakes when the mallet strikes. The Chief pulls himself up to bite at the highlander's throat, but is unable to get his fangs through his target's armor. As the Chief's grip on [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] begins to waiver, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] lands a mighty hammer blow, and the Chief crumbles silently to ash.

At last triumphant, the heroes assess the sarcophagus, the Chief's arms and armor, and the rest of their newly acquired wealth, and how to transport and potentially sell it.

*The companions gathered their newfound wealth with mixed emotions - triumph at having conquered an ancient evil, but also a growing awareness that they were now entangled in mysteries far older and more complex than they had first realized. The silver sarcophagus alone would make them wealthy beyond their dreams, but the magical artifacts they'd claimed might prove far more valuable in the dangerous quests that surely lay ahead.*
