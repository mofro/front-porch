# 2024-11-16 Asterion Log
*Original Date: November 16, 2024*
*Session Ten: On The Road Again (cont.)*

## Summary
Continuing their journey toward the south, the companions encounter the enigmatic elven bandit [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen Malbrinryl]] in person at a roadside inn. Despite her dangerous reputation, she proves more interested in revelry than violence, creating magical illusions to enhance the evening's entertainment. The companions learn more about the complex political situation in the region while gathering intelligence about potential destinations including the mysterious [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]].

## Chapter 13 – On The Road Again (cont.)

The adventurers bypass the walled town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ebrinum|Ebrinum]] the next day, and spend that night in the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Isliger|Isliger]], which sits, aptly enough, on an island in the Liger, accessed by a short ford. Settling into an inn for the night, [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] finds his groove has returned. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] provokes another dance-off, and offends a local favorite, but is happily accepted by the locals, and violence is averted.

A passing reference to the appearance of [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] and her gang at [[Places-of-Asterion#Ligerkilns|Ligerkilns]] elicits mild surprise, as they are said to operate mostly to the north and west of [[Places-of-Asterion#Aurelian|Aurelian]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] recall that the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Morvan|Forest of Morvan]] is home to an elven Lordship of 400-500, headed by [[Dramatis-Personae#Nimtheran Ealoren|Nimtheran Ealoren]]. His was the last such enclave to turn against [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]], and somewhat grudgingly so. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] speculates that [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]] may be obtaining some support there. While the elves here are on more-or-less peaceful terms with the nearby human nobles themselves, they do not police their lands very strictly. Wolves, and occasionally more fearsome monsters, range out of the forest from time to time to raid surrounding farms.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] also hears some tales of a pagan or witch cult to the south, somewhere short of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]], along the upper reaches of the river Aler. The stories, while mildly lurid, are not very specific, and the group is inclined to leave the "witches" in peace.

## An Elven Encounter at Tori

The next day, the heroes proceed along the Volcian road as it turns away from the Liger, following the south edge of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Morvan|Forest of Morvan]] and turning East. Near midday, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] spies some activity in the woods to the north, which she suspects might be elven scouts. She gestures to them, using symbols known in her own community to signify her as elven herself, and a non-hostile traveler, but can see no response.

At dusk, the group approaches a farmhouse, offering some silver for room and board. The farmers are hospitable, and the food palatable. The farmers and their children are more than a little fascinated by their guests. They ask whether the strangers are seeking employment in the construction of a new basilica at [[Places-of-Asterion#Paray|Paray]], to the south – one of many monastery projects being funded by the wealthy Benedictine abbey of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lealand|Lealand]], whose satellites extend through [[Places-of-Asterion#Gallia|Gallia]] and as far as Bellaria and Vitellia.

The adventurers profess (as they have to previous interrogators) to be working as couriers, and offer some tales to entertain their hosts. They learn, in turn, of a mysterious "Wizard's Tower" at St. Peter's Height, on the edge of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] region to the south. Considered the property of the Count of Forest, the tower has been abandoned for decades or more, and has resisted exploration through that time, at the cost of several nobles and men-at-arms. The hosts also mention tales that the wolves that range out of [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Morvan|Morvan]] may include werewolves!

On Monday, July 4, the group reaches the town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Autun|Autun]] in the early afternoon, but decides to spend the night in the security of its walls, given their remaining proximity to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Morvan|Forest of Morvan]]. [[Places-of-Asterion#Autun|Autun]] is a sizable town, surrounded by substantial Volcian ruins, which include parts of its walls, a temple, and a theater. The remains of a necropolis cover hills overlooking the town to the north, and there stands a striking white marble pyramid, some 60' tall, said to have been a monument to the druid king Diviciacus, a contemporary of Julius Caesar.

At the inn that evening, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] stick to their usual ale and beer, as others in the party enjoy the wines for which the Duchy of Burgome is well known. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] supports [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]]'s hurdy-gurdy playing with his own singing to entertain the inn, and the two contemplate organizing a larger band, the better to earn more donations to support their travels.

## Rumors of Treasure and Danger

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] eavesdrops on a rough looking duo of likely thieves who are discussing regional points of interest down the river Sona. One is a mysterious, supposedly enchanted park, supposedly cultivated by a lovelorn elf centuries past, known as "[[Places-of-Asterion#The Garden of the Two of Us|The Garden of the Two of Us]]", and said to guard some sort of treasure at its heart. Another is a ruined tower known as the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]]", said to have once been a wizards tower, and now haunted and still filled with valuable and dangerous personal effects of that forgotten sorcerer. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], curious whether the pair have intentions to loot these locations, asks whether they might hold treasures as valuable as the tower at St. Peter's Height that the peasants had mentioned at their camp of a few days prior. The two chuckle gruffly, apparently finding the suggestion foolhardy, and propose that she explore the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Pit of Orcus|Pit of Orcus]]" (a notorious cave entrance to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Underworld|Underworld]] somewhat further to the southeast) if she is so desirous of a lethal challenge.

Following the Volcian road east out of [[Places-of-Asterion#Autun|Autun]], the adventurers board at another farmhouse the next evening, and continue the next day to the walled town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Macon|Macon]] on the river Sona. Here there are rumors of Volcian coin hoard buried somewhere in town, but no actual clues to its whereabouts. The substantial boat traffic hauling wine and other goods on the Sona makes the prospect of hitching a ride downstream seem appealing (to all save [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], at least). A brief chartered boat trip the next morning delivers the heroes to the city of [[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]], where the Sona joins the river Roth, by the early afternoon of Thursday, July 7.

[[Places-of-Asterion#Ludonum|Ludonum]] is large and old, with sizable Volcian ruins including an amphitheater outside of town. It (like some other old towns along the Roth) is crisscrossed by pedestrian tunnels at street and subterranean levels, which have their own folklore about ghosts and other unsavory trespassers. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] hears tell of yet another "wizard's tower", the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Sublime Citadel|Sublime Citadel]]", further down the river, but the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]]" looms contemptuously over the valley from the hills to the north, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and the rest discuss the possibility of seeking its rumored riches.

Several in the party hear tales of unrest down the river. The King's brother, Karl, has apparently been ransomed and returned from [[Places-of-Asterion#Aegypt|Aegypt]], only to be greeted by revolts in the towns of [[Places-of-Asterion#Arles|Arles]] and [[Places-of-Asterion#Avenio|Avenio]], rumored to have been instigated by his Mother-in-law, Beatrice, who still resents King Ludovic and his family's consolidation of power. More than one passer-by suggests opportunities for [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] as a mercenary in the south.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] seeks news at the Cathedral of St. John. He is unable to talk his way into an audience with Archbishop Philip, but is greeted by Canon Egbert. The Canon does not seem aware of his excommunicate status, or of his literary achievements, but is impressed by his general erudition, and willing to discuss local news. He mentions that he recently had to arrange an exorcism of a local merchant who believed himself cursed after passing the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]]". Concerned that their possible plunder from a raid on that tower might be "taxed" the way their last haul was, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] explores the possibility that the Count of Ludonum might be prevailed upon to give official sanction to an expedition to lay any haunting or monsters to rest. The Canon seems unwilling to broach the subject with the Count personally, but offers a letter of introduction should [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] wish to make an inquiry himself.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and the other adventurers are skeptical about obtaining a commission for the expedition, but consider the possibility of seeking such a sanction after-the-fact – If they can clear the tower of monsters and treasure surreptitiously, it might be worth trying to get official sanction for the project, later claiming that, regrettably, nothing of value was found. Early in the morning of Friday, July 8, they cross the crumbling Volcian bridge over the Sona, and wind up the trail to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]].

## Chapter 14 – Say Yes, to the Fortress!

The tower keep looms over the travelers as they climb, standing perhaps 80' wide, with its battlements standing over 120' tall. The outer curtain wall of a mere 25' only coming into view as they leave the hilltop treeline a few hundred feet away. The group circles the structure cautiously, keeping close to the treeline at first as they assess any possible inhabitants or outside observers. They note no life beyond the occasional bird, but that neither tower nor walls seem drastically decayed. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] begins to toy with the idea of claiming the tower as a base of operations, or perhaps just "flipping" it in a sale to some covetous noble.

Circling toward the north side of the castle, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] notes a hollow in the inner slope of the dry moat that surrounds it, and a hint of some sort of door. Leaving their donkey cart in the trees, the adventurers cautiously advance and confirm the presence of an iron reinforced door, which resists shouldering by even [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] looses [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] from her traveling skin, and she slips beneath the door, finding a heavy oaken bar on the far side that she is able to lift from its stone loops to fall to the floor. A 7'x5' passage lies behind, which [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] confirms is directed toward the tower as the heroes advance.

After creeping over 100', the passage opens onto a stairway curving up through a larger chamber, seemingly in the tower's foundations. Below, in the center of the chamber, a 25' wide, stone-framed pool of water lies still and black. [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] scampers down the steps to dive in and investigate the murk, but is almost immediately bitten by something large and slimy. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], immediately aware of the threat, alerts the party. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']] charge down to support the water nymph, though she quickly slips free of her assailant's needle-sharp teeth.

Suddenly the surface of the pool erupts as seven giant frogs, the size of large dogs, spring from the pool to attack! After their initial biting lunge, they belch toxic gas at the heroes. Despite the shock, the defenders blunt the attack with minor injuries. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], though blinded and choking, looses a lightning bolt into the pool as the last of the frogs falls. The chamber is still for a moment, before another frog, twice the size of the rest, leaps from the pool for a renewed attack on [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]. It resists a few blows from the mobilized adventurers until [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] arrives to messily split it asunder.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] manages to heal himself, drawing on [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]]'s energy to do so, and then he and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] tend to the wounds of the others. Even after they are healed, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] ruminates on [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin|Puddin]]'s injuries – how he might obtain armor for his new hound, and whether he might secretly be too soft-hearted to take a a poor, dumb, loyal beast into harm's way with him.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] enters the stagnant pool to regenerate her expended energy, and can now explore it unmolested. She finds numerous dead tadpoles at various stages of development, but nothing else of note. The rest of the party explores the four entrances radiating from the chamber, finding mostly rotten food, kegs of vinegar, and other decayed supplies. Two chambers extend down a bit deeper than the base of the staircase, and contain large, iron-barred cages, and scattered debris including human and animal bones.

The adventurers proceed up the staircase to the vaulted ceiling 60' above the pool. Above it is another chamber with a ceiling only 10' above, dominated by a large, "c"-shaped table of dimensions similar to the pool below. Another flight ascended brings them to the ground floor, with large, diamond-paned glass windows stretching 20' high, a large, barred gate to the courtyard outside, and a few traces of rotten furniture scattered about. Crossing to the other side of the hall, another flight of stairs climbs to a flatter tower-spanning chamber, about 10' high, lit through a few slit windows, and also littered with sparse furniture remnants. A nearly identical empty floor is found directly above that, but yet another flight of stairs leads to a similar level that is thickly strewn with wooden debris, and much glittering shattered glass.

*As the companions gazed up the staircase leading to the upper levels of the mysterious tower, the sounds of the wind through shattered glass above seemed to whisper warnings. What manner of wizard had once dwelt in this place, and what guardians had he left behind to protect his secrets? The giant frogs had been merely the first test - whatever lay ahead in the tower's heights would surely prove far more dangerous.*
