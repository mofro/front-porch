# 2024-12 Asterion Log
*Original Date: December 7, 2024*
*Session Eleven: Deeper Into the Tower*

## Summary
The companions continue their exploration of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]], ascending to the fourth level where they confront animated statues defending a bizarre billiard court. Their trek upward brings them face to face with the tower's most fearsome guardian - a hovering liver-like entity that commands lightning and draws vitality from those who approach. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] finally overcomes this horror with a well-placed acid jet.

## Chapter 14 – Say Yes, to the Fortress! (cont.)
The adventurers cautiously ascend the spiral stairs. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] "pings" the ceiling area as they approach, and fleetingly senses a tiny object in motion, but nobody can offer visual confirmation. As [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] nears the top of the stairs, his tunic suddenly bursts into flame. He swiftly extinguishes them magically, with only slight burns, but proceeds with greater suspicion, certain that the fire was magically caused.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] peeks up into the next floor, which has even more minimal furnishings than the last. Narrow diamond glass windows are present at the center of each of the four "lobes" of the tower. The stone floor bears extensive lines and arcs, marked in chalk. At the center of the floor is a spherical bronze framework, which [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] later identifies as an armillary sphere – a physical representation of planets and stellar constellations. In the center of each of the lobes stands a 5' post, supporting a 6' copper tube, with crossed wires at either end. But most conspicuously, and menacingly, a 10' purplelish, almost liver-colored, but iridescent, fleshy mass floats over the armillary sphere. It's about 2½' thick, with rounded edges ringed by a slowly undulating fin, and it pulses, ever so slowly, while emanating a sound akin to breathing. The air bears a faintly metallic scent, like that after a thunderstorm.

## The Living Statues
[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] make their way up to the floor – [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] to observe, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] to prepare in case the hovering mass makes a hostile move. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] studies the floating "liver" thing, but has never seen it's like before, in nature or magic. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] soon grows bored with the lack of hostile moves, before abruptly staggering, feeling weakened and disoriented. He makes his way back down the staircase to the more secure 4th level. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] "pings" for any invisible threats, and again notes a tiny object, which seems to duck behind the floating Liver, near the next ascending staircase. Now it is [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] who reels from an invisible attack, which he is able to identify as resulting from dehydration, probably magically induced.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] calls for [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] to join him on the 5th floor, and she moves out to triangulate on the tiny flier, but sees nothing. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] casts an area-affecting Frost spell on the space behind the liver, which indeed makes a flying object stand out, sparkling, for [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]. Aiming carefully, she looses an arrow, striking the object and causing it to vanish in a shower of snowy sparkles. The Liver, meanwhile, floats and breathes, unperturbed.

The last of the heroes advance off the stairs and spread out, observing the Liver while [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] partially heals himself. As they begin to advance into the other half of the tower, however, a buzzing, crackling sound resonates through the chamber. Jagged arcs of lightning lash from the edges of the liver toward all of the adventurers, while a trunk-like tentacle ending with a fang-rimmed mouth reaches toward [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]].

All of the adventurers dodge the threatening appendages, and attempt to counterattack. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] hurls an axe which cleaves deep into the abomination, releasing a flow of purplish ichor and triggering a disturbing shriek, though the creature seems largely impervious to the other heroes' blows. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] launches repeated magical Ice Daggers, which punch small holes in the creature to bubble a bit of the same ichor, but don't seem to otherwise distress the beast. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] lands two more hits with axes as the group manages to continue nimbly dodging, and finally [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] responds to [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s irritated pleas to use more obviously formidable spells. An acid jet rips open the Liver, which falls to the floor, swiftly deliquescing in a mass of coolly boiling ichor. At [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]' request, [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] runs down to the 3rd floor and retrieves glass vials with which enough of the ethereal goo is collected to function as 4 [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Paut Potions|paut potions]].

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] are healed from their dehydration distress, and the group briefly discusses ways to expedite healing in the midst of combat. Beyond simply distributing healing potions, it is proposed that [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s new dog, [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin|Puddin']], (whose fragility in a stand-up fight has been apparent) might carry some potions that he could then carry quickly to anyone in need.

## The Mystic Mist
[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] climbs the next spiral stair, finding a locked wooden hatch at its summit. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] is summoned to force entry, which he does easily, permitting [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] to enter the lightless room above. He pings the room, determining it to be a fairly narrow corridor, such light as penetrates from below reveals a gray haze that would limit visibility even with better light. Soon [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] feels lightheaded and retreats back to the floor below, realizing that the air is stale and unbreathable. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] moves up the stairs to create fresh air to flush the corridor, and recognizes that the space is also under the effect of a Mystic Mist spell – a defensive ward that will disadvantage intruders even once the air and light issues are dealt with. Soon [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] is again struck by a dehydration spell and retreats down the stairs.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] detects no flying objects on the 5th floor, and the group deduces that the spotter for the spells must be concealed in the dark corridor. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] therefore advance and close themselves in the corridor, where [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] casts another Frost spell. With some difficulty, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] spots another frosty ball tucked into an upper corner of the room, and destroys it with a bolt from his crossbow.

Resolving to maintain the momentum of their advance, the group moves up into the corridor en masse. They open the side doors of the corridor, finding bedchambers with outside windows, wider than those below. But navigation is still impeded by the Mystic Mist, and the adventurers stumble and move with confusion, often into rooms other than they intended. The furnishings of the chambers seem lavishly appointed, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] finds and lays claim to a [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Mirror Cloth Handkerchief|handkerchief of "mirror cloth"]] found on a dressing table.

## The Wizard's Study
The end of the corridor, at the apparent center of the tower, has double doors which appear to be magically locked, and resist even [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s emphatic battering. After some debate over an approach to breaching it, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] directs acid jets to destroy the hinges, and the doors topple to the floor. Behind them is revealed a whirlwind, from which lightning flashes, and a bolt snakes through the assembled adventurers. They largely dodge its effects, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] is flung back down the hallway by the wind, and the others' counterattacks are no more fruitful. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] launches an acid ball, which disrupts it somewhat, but also sprays back into the heroes, damaging them and their armor.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], meanwhile, has decided to outflank their unknown foe, and finds her way to a window in her bedroom. Noting the outside of the tower top to be free of Mystic Mist, she climbs along its exterior, 100' off the ground. At the next corner of the tower, she jimmies the window. This room is also Mist-shrouded, but filled with books and scrolls and curios suggestive of a wizard's study. She searches the tables and shelves through the Mist for signs of the wizard himself, but finds nothing before she feels the lightheaded symptoms of a dehydration attack. With no target to strike back against, she charges out the door into the adjoining hallway. Noting the battle with the whirlwind to her right, she continues on to the next chamber. It proves to be as sparsely furnished as the previous bedchambers, but in place of a lushly appointed canopy bed, it features a stone slab piled with furs.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] shield-rushes the whirlwind, and forces past it into the hallway beyond. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] calls out that she's encountered no wizard in either of her rooms, and the two decide to continue up the next flight of stairs. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], meanwhile, uses a Move Earth spell to bore a hole in the ceiling to the roof. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] vault up through it and commence searching the four peaked roofs over the lobes of the tower. The whirlwind, however, rather than pressing home its attack, backs away from the door it had been guarding, positioning itself in the doorway to the wizard's study.

By the time [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] reach the roof, [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] have peered through two access hatches on the tower roofs, and found nothing. Deciding that the wizard might be concealed in the study, the pairs reverse their respective courses to the 6th floor. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], having identified the whirlwind as an air elemental, diffuse and resistant against most physical attacks, decides that an explosive effect is required. He launches an Explosive Lightning spell, and decisively snuffs the elemental out.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] rushes back into the study, and searches through the assorted books and junk for a lurking wizard, and sees no cabinets or structures large enough to conceal a human. However, her keen elven vision spies a slight flicker of movement on the porch of a tiny wooden house in a glass-fronted box on a high shelf on the wall. Not sure what to expect, she springs up onto the counter below it, and peers carefully at the house. Just as [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] reach the door to the study, there's an abrupt POP, as a stone bullet bursts out of the glass. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] is struck squarely in the chest and hurled back to the center of the floor, gravely wounded. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] cannot see an assailant, but with another Explosive Lightning spell ready, launches it at the tiny house as he and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] backpedal. The whole upper corner of the study is blasted to splinters. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] are then able to swiftly heal [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], reviving her from the brink of death.

## Magical Treasures
[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] theorizes that a tiny alchemical homunculus was left behind by the original wizard occupant of the tower (when he left for parts unknown) to supervise its defense. As the group had drawn closer to the wizard's study, the homunculus had observed them via Invisible Wizard Eyes, and cast Ignite Fire and Dehydration spells to harass them as they battled the various guardians of the tower.

Amid the various documents and tools of research in the study, the group finds various items of interest, some of which [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] can readily identify, though others will require more extended research:

- One Arabic parchment scroll with extensive annotations in Latin, possibly on the topic of optics [8lbs]
- One Arabic book on lacquered paper [24lbs]
- Scattered parchment pages that can be reconstructed into a Latin alchemical primer with extensive annotations in an unknown cypher
- [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Magical Scrolls from Astaragat's Tower|Magical scrolls]]: Mature, Distill, Essential Flame, Air Vision, Pentagram, Gift of Letters, Utter Wall
- 6-gallon ceramic amphora full of Essential Water
- 3 Timed Candles
- 1 scattered box of Alchemist Matches
- [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Silver Estoc|Silver estoc]] – Blade engraved with serpents, gorgons, and vining flowers, and the letters "AZOTH"
- [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Silver Plate Talismans|Silver plate talismans]] on silver chain necklaces (+4 vs Fire, +4 vs Poison, +4 vs Arrows)
- [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Malachite Basin|Malachite basin]] carved with dolphins and sea serpents, on silver tripod
- [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Spider Silk Rope|Spider Silk rope]] 90' 3/8" – 4.5lbs, 600lb test
- Found in second bedroom – [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Crystal Decanter|crystal decanter of perfume]]
- Found in stone slab bedroom – [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Purple-Tinged Pearl Necklace|Gold necklace set with strings of purple-tinged pearls]]

## The Deadly Courtyard
After sorting through the debris in the study, the adventurers descend to the ground floor, collecting their bottles from the glass room along the way. Realizing that they have yet to explore the tower's courtyard, [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] remove the mighty bar to the door, and open it. The ground outside is bare, dry dirt, sparsely crisscrossed by straight marks as if some large object had been dragged across it. As the two step out to investigate, they hear something rush up around the tower, and turn to see the horrific sight of a rigid serpent, perhaps 60' long and 4' thick. Its rooster-like head bears sickle-like antlers, and seems to aggressively emit a complex odor of fruit, nuts, acid, and corruption. The heroes' eyes burn and throb at the sight of it, their stomachs churning and hearts racing erratically. They immediately recoil into the tower and secure the door behind them, feeling a couple loud thumps and hearing a crackling sound as if the door itself is wracking out of proportion to the blows, before all is quiet again.

As [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] describe the beast, while rinsing their teary, stinging eyes with their recently acquired Essential Water, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] concludes that they have survived an encounter with a basilisk – a creature so toxic that the sight of it is lethal. There is hurried discussion of possible strategies for attacking such a thing, but the consensus is that it is best left to roam the courtyard, at least so long as the group is utilizing the tower and dungeons as a base. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], however, considers the basilisk to be an abomination in the eyes of God. While he still has a good sense of its location outside the door, he surreptitiously blind-casts a Flesh-to-Ice spell, and transmutes the creature, sealing its fate on a summer late afternoon. His comrades are not pleased.

*The companions had conquered the [[Places-of-Asterion#Abode of Chaos|Abode of Chaos]], defeating its guardians and claiming its magical treasures. But as [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]' final act with the basilisk demonstrated, their victory came with internal tensions. The tower now stood as a potential base of operations - if they could agree on how to use it - and its magical treasures would prove valuable in the challenges that lay ahead.*
