# 2025-03 Asterion Log
*Original Date: March 15, 2025*
*Session Fourteen: Facing the Gorgon*

## Summary
The companions face the dreaded gorgon [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakëndrixris]] in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]], cleverly using reflective helmets and blind fighting tactics to avoid petrification. Despite [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] being turned to stone during the battle, they manage to defeat the creature and discover the petrified form of [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] the centaur. With these stone figures in tow, they return to [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]] where [[Dramatis-Personae#Bishop Vivianus|Bishop Vivianus]] performs a miracle, restoring both to flesh. From the grateful centaur, they learn more about [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]]'s movements and the possible location of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]].

## Chapter 17 – Facing the Gorgon
[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] climbs a stone tree to better observe the village, but sees no activity, including in the steeple. She and the rest of the adventurers note that the shrubs and small trees of the village appear to be made of stone, somewhat weathered, and obviously too detailed to have been carved, instead appearing to have been petrified from living vegetation. They also note pieces of statues littering the road – apparently past visitors who were also petrified, and then shattered into fragments. Also notably, while the flesh of the victims seems to have petrified abruptly, while their clothing and possessions of once-living material seem to have transformed only slowly, weathering before and after turning to stone. Any metal possessions, meanwhile, have been unaffected, except by long exposure to the elements.

The heroes cautiously approach the church until the doors open and a goblin emerges, dressed in the usual rags and wearing a burlap bag over its head. While it does not seem immediately threatening, most of the group hangs back while [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] advance to parley. The goblin demands that the group state their purpose, and present any tribute they might bear for his Mistress, [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakëndrixris]]. He does not respond productively to questions, leading [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] to try to pull the sack from his head, though she is foiled by a chinstrap.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] detects sounds from behind, and sounds the alarm as eight wargs lunge from around the surrounding hovels to attack. The rest of the heroes scramble to defend against the warg rush, while falling back against a hovel. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], however, keeps her attention on the goblin, hitting him in the face with an arrow, and sticking another in his leg as he retreats to the church, though he manages to hop back in the front doors. Meanwhile, the wargs are soon wiped out.

The adventurers enter the church, but the goblin has apparently left through its back doors. Inside are several more "statues", notably less damaged than those outside. Two appear to be dressed as Saracens, and the rest in more common Gallian attire. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] climbs to the steeple, and can see the churchyard behind the church, but the canopy of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]] behind it impedes observation. Meanwhile, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] advance to the back of the church, and the mighty Caledonian easily runs down the hobbling goblin in the churchyard and carries him back inside.

Finding that questioning the goblin remains unproductive, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] suspects that he barely comprehends Gallian, and attempts to communicate in Orcish, which is more successful. He establishes that there are more goblins and wargs in service to [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakëndrixris]], and that she is most likely to be found in her "garden" some distance through the stone woods behind the churchyard.

As the interrogation proceeds, the rest of the group searches the statues in the church. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] notes one of them bears a finely-crafted brass horn, with enamel depictions of musicians, and quickly claims it.

In hopes it will lead the adventurers to the gorgon, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] heals the goblin's leg. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] breaks off the arrow in its face so that it can pull the sack over its head again, and it promptly scampers off. The group follows at a distance down the narrow trail through the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]]. The path is narrow, and deviation from it is hindered by the thick petrified undergrowth. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] advances ahead of the rest of the group, since his blindness makes him less vulnerable to a sudden gorgon sighting.

After advancing a hundred yards or so, the path ends beside a carved standing stone, and opens into a sunken field, scattered with more shattered statues and a few more standing stones, at the center of which stands a stone slab on pillars.

Sensing something stirring under the slab, and believing that they have found the "garden", [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] disengages, and withdraws down to confer with the rest of the party. Several of them don their experimental "reflector helmets", and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] considers various options for magical attack, but they note that the petrified vegetation limits the options for encirclement should they choose to advance. All of discussion abruptly halts, however, as the gorgon preemptively charges with a shriek down the path.

Mercifully, only [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] happens to be facing in her direction, but the other heroes are horrified to see his eyes widen and flesh turn a pale, limestone gray.

The group scrambles to form some sort of defense while averting their eyes from the threat. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] magically raises an earthen wall to block the path, and prepares an acid rain to fall on the gorgon behind it. But [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakëndrixris]] veers around the barrier, and she brandishes a two-handed sword over her head as her serpentine bulk crumbling easily through the petrified vegetation. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] backpedals to brace against the barrier and blindly duel with the gorgon, but she proves able to hold her own against the giant, and quickly bloodies him with repeated heavy blows. [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] hurries to support the Caledonian with magical healing, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] pepper the gorgon with arrows. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s uncanny senses prove telling, as he strikes out his target's eyes, apparently neutering the petrifying effect, though her swordplay seems undiminished.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] backs up the attacks with a steady jet of acid that begins to slough scales off her belly. But a trio of wargs charges down the other side of the path, putting him in jeopardy. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] redirect their arrows to the new threat, but one manages to reach [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], and clamp its jaws onto the mage's groin rendering him unconscious before the beast is felled. Finally, a weary [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] summons the strength to lop off [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakëndrixris]]' head, and she collapses in a heap.

As the group catches its breath, the gorgon's wounds show signs of healing, and there is fresh debate about possible ways to keep an immortal foe suppressed for, if not forever, then at least a useful scale in terms of human lifetimes. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] ultimately magically encases the carcass and head in earth, transforms it to stone, and buries it yards deep. Fanning out to search the "garden", the adventurers spot a stone centaur, which they deduce is likely [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], with fortunately only the hair of his tail snapped off.

Other "statuary" yields potential treasures. A headless elf warrior carries a magical quiver resembling a conical sea shell holding 13 finely-crafted enchanted arrows. A disembodied hand holds a thumb-sized polished calcite stone. The heroes collect those items and various other bits of arms and armor, as well as the petrified [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], load them into their donkey cart, and proceed cautiously back through [[Places-of-Asterion#Balton|Balton]] to [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]].

## Pallikari's Tale
On Friday, July 29th, the heroes are received at [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]] cathedral by a duly impressed [[Dramatis-Personae#Monsignor Roderick|Monsignor Roderick]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] providing silent testimony as to the truth of their tale of facing the gorgon. At a special Sunday Mass, [[Dramatis-Personae#Bishop Vivianus|Bishop Vivianus]] pronounces a blessing that restores the dwarf and centaur to flesh and blood. [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], startled to suddenly find himself in the middle of a throng of human worshipers, bolts for the city gate, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] uses his magical "Great Voice" helmet to explain that they are friends of [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]], and mean him no harm. The adventurers escort him to a small inn outside of the city to exchange tales, lubricated by an ample supply of wine.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] claims to be a bit over 200 years old, and is starting to feel his age. He reports, with notable dejection, that he did not find [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]] in the gorgon's garden. He had fought alongside Quickpath in [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s army, before quitting not long after her notorious burning of the Abbey of St. Richarius outside Centula 20-some years ago – All of the unicorns had deserted at once after this event, and it is widely believed to cemented the alliance of the major elf lords with the humans against her.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] volunteers that the heroes were seeking Quickpath in hopes of locating the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]], specifically to destroy it ([[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] doesn't press the point that he would prefer not to be so hasty about the destruction). [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] explains that while he has no particular interest in the armor, it was the impetus for his decision to search the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]] for Quickpath.

When [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] last saw his friend, he believed that he was plotting to stop [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] somehow, and had probably taken the Veil, which had ultimately led to her demise. The [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]] is reasonably close to Quickpath's original home, and was a likely place that might have come to his mind in seeking to leave the armor someplace particularly inaccessible – [[Dramatis-Personae#Kakëndrixris|Kakëndrixris]] would have made an ideal unwitting guardian. In his brief inspection before encountering the gorgon, [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] had feared that Quickpath's remains might simply have been pulverized, but since the heroes apparently didn't find the Veil, he has hope that he had simply been wrong about Quickpath's intentions.

He apparently believes that the High Elves are also seeking the Veil, though he doesn't elaborate his reasoning, except that it might relate to the mysterious disappearance of her High Elf husband, [[Dramatis-Personae#Indolion Malbrinryl|Indolion]], rumored to have been the result of some complex High Elf or Wood Elf intrigue. Asked about [[Dramatis-Personae#Nierynwen Malbrinryl|Nierynwen]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] professes to never have met her, but to know her by reputation. He is doubtful that the bandit is truly [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s long-lost daughter (a hoax being quite in character for the monstrous sort of elf who would still glorify Aramaina).

[[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] confirms pieces of [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s history that the group has heard previously, including that after the loss of her husband and daughter she had wandered extensively. Somewhere in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] she had some sort of mystical experience and found the Veil, shortly before the death of her patron, [[Dramatis-Personae#Lydaer Elentaurae|King Lydaer]] who, heirless, left her the throne of Armorica in his will. Her crusade began upon her return and assumption of the throne. [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] has no further ideas about where Quickpath might have taken the Veil, but the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]], where it was found, might hold more insights as to its nature.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]] parts company with the group, stating that he will likely travel west to Ibria, seeking to distance himself from human civilization, but will welcome them should their paths cross.

*The companions had successfully faced one of the deadliest creatures of legend and survived to tell the tale. With [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] restored and valuable new insights from [[Dramatis-Personae#Pallikari|Pallikari]], their quest seemed to be gaining momentum. Yet the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]] remained elusive, and the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] - where [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] had her mystical experience - now beckoned. Whatever secrets lay hidden in those misty peaks might finally lead them to [[Dramatis-Personae#Corin Quickpath|Corin Quickpath]] and the legendary armor that had changed the course of history.*
