# 2025-05-03 Asterion Log
*Original Date: May 3, 2025*
*Session Sixteen: Deeper Into the Smoking Hills*

## Summary
The adventurers crawl the taverns of [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]] seeking more information about the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] and some of the points of interest they've heard named, hoping for further information on [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s experiences there, and the origin of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil]]. They encounter the horrifying [[Dramatis-Personae#Maggot Farmers|Maggot Farmers]] - zombies controlled by parasitic flies - before reaching the safety of [[Places-of-Asterion#Mimata|Mimata]] where they gather valuable intelligence and maps from [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Astorg of Payr|Baron Astorg]] of [[Places-of-Asterion#Dragon Rock|Dragon Rock]].

## Legends of the Smoking Hills

The adventurers crawl the taverns of [[Places-of-Asterion#Rodess|Rodess]] seeking more information about the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] and some of the points of interest they've heard named, hoping for further information on [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s experiences there, and the origin of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil]].

"[[Places-of-Asterion#Dragon Rock|Dragon Rock]]" is said to be an active volcano that has erupted a couple times in the past century or so, expending most of its force laterally down a thousand foot deep gorge, left blasted and now known as the "Valley of Hell". The eastern, leeward side of the summit is the site of the purportedly impregnable baronial castle.

"[[Places-of-Asterion#Lake Terror|Lake Terror]]" sits in a mountaintop crater, and is known for vivid coloration – sky blue on clear days, almost black on overcast ones – and for emitting occasional sulfurous odors. Water drawn from its depths is said to be even more strongly odorous, and effervescent, and is reputed to have therapeutic properties. Legend has it that the village of Bess once sat in a valley at the site. Some claim that it was inundated in divine retribution for some sort of transgression, but the most elaborate tales say that a devilish "[[Dramatis-Personae#Lord Rupus|Lord Rupus]]" fell in love with the beautiful Helen, the baker's daughter. When she refused to marry him in favor of the young blacksmith, Rupus is said to have retreated to a rock structure called the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|Devil's Chair]]", and begun to cry. His tears gradually filled the hilltop crater with water, forcing the villagers to leave their homes. Incorrectly believing Helen dead in the flood, Lord Rupus dove into the lake and clung to the church bell, falling asleep there. It is said that throwing a stone into the middle of the lake can ring the bell, which would wake Rupus, or the Devil himself. In some versions, the "[[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|Devil's Chair]]" retains to this day the power to grant wishes for retribution. The group's own [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] claims to be unaware of any relations in the area, but listens to the tales with curiosity, and a little apprehension about the complications they might pose to his already contentious relationship with the Church.

Most tales, however, seem to associate [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]]'s "vision", and discovery of the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil]], most closely with either [[Places-of-Asterion#Mount Orpheus|Mount Orpheus]] (probably the most active volcanic peak in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]], and a rumored entrance to the Underworld, perhaps that used by the mythological Orpheus), or the Grand Dome (the tallest peak, particularly goblin-haunted, and topped by the ruins of an ancient Volcian temple to Mercury).

## The Horror of the Maggot Farmers

On Monday, August 1st, the heroes set out for the walled town of [[Places-of-Asterion#Mimata|Mimata]], intending to seek further information there, before working their way north though the various points of interest in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]]. They pass again through [[Places-of-Asterion#Balton|Balton]], before following a more westerly course through the forests of Rodia and climbing into the Hills. They hear the howls of distant wargs through the night before resuming their climb into the highlands, where they spy a small farmhouse at mid-morning. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] notes a couple scattered farmers moving awkwardly, and approaches cautiously before noting their unnaturally large and misshapen heads.

As the farmers ominously advance on the party, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] recognizes their heads as resembling mud beehives, and in fact sees insects swarming around them. She backpedals to the party as [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] calls out to the farmers, trying to ascertain their intent, but fears the worst. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] recognizes the insects surrounding the closest farmer as flies, rather than bees, as all the farmers lurch closer. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] urges her to strike first, and she looses an arrow, but it sticks in the farmer's hive-head ineffectually.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] follows up with a shot to pin the nearest farmer's foot to the ground, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] further creates a Wall of Fire as a barrier to the farmer and its flies. The farmers, five in all, prove to be slow, but persistent combatants, taking repeated blows to subdue. Yet the heroes quickly prevail, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s sword and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]' acid jet finishing the most. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] cracks open one of of the hives to find a skull inside, as [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] produces fire to dispose of the corpses and fly swarms. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] explores the nearby farmhouse, and is horrified to discover a crib containing a hive-headed baby – she advises the rest to spare themselves the inspection, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] torches the house as well. The shaken adventurers press on to reach [[Places-of-Asterion#Mimata|Mimata]] by dusk.

## Intelligence Gathering in Mimata

They find the town unusually busy given its remote location, but its walls provide welcome refuge for traders seeking to transit the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] between the County of Tholoza to the south and the Aler river valley to the north. There also seems to be a fair number of mercenaries and adventurers exploring this relatively lawless region, and possibly also seeking to claim the goblin ear bounty.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] encounters a pair of young elves who share the legend of [[Dramatis-Personae#Lady Gliressë of the Silken Gown|Lady Gliressë of the Silken Gown]] – An elf princess who supposedly coveted the secrets of a powerful human sorcerer a thousand years before, seducing and ultimately betraying him. The enraged sorcerer laid a fearful curse on her head, rendering her so hideous that she retreated to a cave somewhere in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] where she is said to hide to this day with the sorcerer's treasure. While the elves joke about potentially rescuing the princess, they are apparently actually enroute to a different cave complex known as Blackbird Hollow – supposedly a lair of bandits, witches, werewolves, and other nefarious sorts along the river Lot, in the forests of the County of Cahors perhaps a hundred miles to the west.

On the morning of August 3rd, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] visits the cathedral of St. Private of [[Places-of-Asterion#Mimata|Mimata]]. He meets with the librarian, [[Dramatis-Personae#Brother Oliver|Brother Oliver]], who is actually familiar with his works, and quite talkative about local lore and gossip. He identifies the group's hive-headed assailants as "[[Dramatis-Personae#Maggot Farmers|Maggot Farmers]]", effectively zombies created by a cursed variety of fly that nests in victims heads, controlling them after the brain is devoured.

He further provides less horrifying insight as to the local power structure. [[Dramatis-Personae#Bishop Odilon of Seart|Bishop Odilon]] of Seart controls the city, and by royally-conferred right is ruler of the [[Places-of-Asterion#County of Gabalum|County of Gabalum]], though technically the title of Count is held by the King of Caesaraugusta, in Ibria, and the Barons of the county acknowledge the Bishop's authority grudgingly, if at all. The castle atop [[Places-of-Asterion#Dragon Rock|Dragon Rock]] is the seat of [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Astorg of Payr|Baron Astorg]] of Payr, who openly declares his fealty to [[Dramatis-Personae#King Jacob the Conqueror|King Jacob the Conqueror]]. Though Jacob is bound by oath not to press his territorial claims in southern Gallia, he does control the prosperous Lordship of Lockmount only about 75 miles south.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] shares tales of the adventurers' heroic escapades thus far, and seeks access to any accounts of [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] lore in the cathedral's library. [[Dramatis-Personae#Brother Oliver|Oliver]] is happy to aid such an esteemed scholar, and is even persuaded to provide access to some spells in the Library – notably spells of Major Healing and Cure Disease, which [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] arranges to copy. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] even finds the nominally "sensitive" Necromantic spells of Sense Spirit and Turn Spirit, but the group already possesses the former, and decides that the latter would take too long to master to be worth copying for now.

## Meeting Baron Astorg

The party lingers in [[Places-of-Asterion#Mimata|Mimata]] to permit copying of the spells before proceeding northwest to [[Places-of-Asterion#Dragon Rock|Dragon Rock]] on Friday, August 5th. They arrive before nightfall, and are at first unsuccessful in seeking an audience with the Baron, but they note some mysterious figures hanging at the back of the audience as they perform at the Three Torches Inn. One of the observers proves to be the Baron's herald, who summons [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] to [[Places-of-Asterion#Dragon Rock|Dragon Rock]] castle the next day. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] makes a point of carrying a wineskin with [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] inside, permitting [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] to eavesdrop on the conversation.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Astorg of Payr|Astorg]] personally meets with [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], expressing an interest in hiring [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] for his retinue, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] dissuades him, saying that the group might be available for more specific, limited term tasks. The Baron seems to require no such services at present, but offers the group a retainer, giving him the right of first refusal of their services if another local baron, or particularly [[Dramatis-Personae#Bishop Odilon of Seart|Bishop Odilon]], should seek to hire them. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] agrees, so long as the Baron will also provide copies of his maps of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]]. The group lingers another day in [[Places-of-Asterion#Dragon Rock|Dragon Rock]] while the maps are prepared, and sets off for [[Places-of-Asterion#Lake Terror|Lake Terror]] on Monday the 8th.

At midday, a few miles east of where they reckon the [[Places-of-Asterion#Forest of Stone|Forest of Stone]] to be, the heroes see half a dozen broad pairs of vulture-like wings soaring ominously high overhead. Abruptly, the wings all at once dive upon them in a seeming attack!

*As winged creatures descended from the sky toward them, the companions reflected on how the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] seemed to harbor every form of horror imaginable. From the fly-controlled [[Dramatis-Personae#Maggot Farmers|Maggot Farmers]] to the political complexities of competing baronies and bishoprics, this region appeared to be a crossroads of ancient evil and modern intrigue. With [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Astorg of Payr|Baron Astorg]]'s maps in their possession, they were better equipped to navigate the treacherous terrain ahead, but the aerial assault now beginning suggested that the worst challenges still lay before them.*
