# 2025-06-07 Asterion Log
*Original Date: June 7, 2025*
*Session Seventeen: Deeper Into the Smoking Hills (cont.)*

## Summary
The companions face aerial assault from harpies and perytons before reaching [[Places-of-Asterion#Lake Terror|Lake Terror]], where they discover the [[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|Devil's Chair]] and its connection to a magical ley line of vengeance. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] recovers a massive powerstone bell from the lake's depths, and the party adopts the name "Viaticum Legionis" (Last Rites Legion) after defeating a goblin raiding party. They continue following the ley line north toward [[Places-of-Asterion#Mount Orpheus|Mount Orpheus]], ready to face whatever mysteries await them.

## Chapter 18 – Deeper Into the Smoking Hills (cont.)

The heroes barely have time to draw their weapons as their winged foes dive in, talons raised and emitting an ululating wail. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']] all abruptly freeze before the winged attackers quite reach them, driving those talons into the two largest targets. Five of the seven aerial attackers have deer-like, antlered heads and fearsome fangs. The remaining two look like hideous elderly women from the waist up, caked with feces, and appear to be the ones responsible for the eerie shrieking/singing – quickly identified by [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] as harpies. Those two arrest their dives a bit above the height of [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne's]] head, and continue their vocal accompaniment as the rest wrench their claws in their intended prey.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] use their respective long weapons to strike back at the attackers as [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] hurriedly conjures an acid riposte. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] notes that the non-harpy beasts seem to cast shadows as if they were normal humans. The claws worrying [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] seem to break the spell hindering them, and the two are soon able to counterattack as well. As one harpy falls to an acid jet, concluding her song, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']] are also able to join the fray. The beasts with their talons dug into [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] are beaten loose. Though one manages to wound [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] with its antlers, all are finished in short order.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] identifies the winged beasts supporting the harpies as Perytons, a somewhat less intelligent species of carnivorous avians, said to acquire the shadow of the last human they killed. He and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] heal the wounded, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] collects feathers, claws, and horns from all the fallen foes, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] magically ignites a pyre to dispose of the remaining corpses.

## Night Siege and the Last Rites Legion

The adventurers proceed to the north and west toward [[Places-of-Asterion#Lake Terror|Lake Terror]], making camp at dusk. The night begins quietly, but the howls of wargs grow more intense this night than usual, and their tones indicate that some are drawing closer. The adventurers all wake for what would normally be the second watch shift, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] hears subdued canine vocalizations (probably intended to be masked by louder and more distant calls), that indicate some wargs are encircling their encampment.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] prepares a ring of fire, anchored by a clump of brush at one side of the encampment, and open at the other end, intended to channel any attackers into a killing zone. Alas, soon after he ignites it, arrows begin to fall around the group, launched from the dark on all sides through the flames. Fired more-or-less blindly, only a few hit the adventurers (particularly [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], the largest target), but they continue steadily, and unopposed. No attackers approach on foot and, in frustration, the heroes decide to sally forth through the brush, charging behind [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] to break free of the siege ring.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] again is the primary target of the arrows, but his armor and tough hide prove resistant to most of them. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] supports the charge with her own bow, and the goblin front sics their warg mounts on the heroes' column, but the charge's concentrated force shatters the thin goblin line. Those not engaged soon scatter in the dark, and the rest slain, but for two goblins captured. The adventurers debate the fate of the captives, and consider using them to deliver a warning to their tribe to keep their distance, but the captives seem not to understand Gallian or any other language attempted. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] composes a letter in Elvish, to the effect that the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] are no longer undefended, and the Goblins should stay in their caves and cause no more trouble. He signs the note with the group's new (and much debated) name, "Viaticum Legionis", or "Last Rites Legion", tucks it into the rags worn by one goblin, and sends him on his way, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] slays the other with a hammer blow, for emphasis.

## The Devil's Chair and the Ley Line

The sun is well risen by now, and the weary adventurers press on toward [[Places-of-Asterion#Lake Terror|Lake Terror]], reaching an overlooking hill by mid-morning on August 9th. About 750 yards across, its still waters beautifully reflect the clear summer sky. Seeing no activity on the lake, the adventurers descend the steep side of the valley to investigate, and search for the so-called [[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|"Devil's Chair"]]. The descent to the lake is steep, and the footing sometimes treacherous, but before long [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] notes a rock outcropping overlooking the water, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] climbs to see a depression in the middle of it that looks like it could serve as a seat.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] climbs into the Chair, noting that the natural posture while thus seated looks not down, over the lake, but up, to the north – a position more of contemplation than of observation. He meditates for a time, and feels certain magical currents in the area – evocative of themes of retribution... vengeance... perhaps justice... The "current" seems like what are sometimes referred to as "Ley Lines", particularly when they manifest as geographic alignments of recognized sacred or holy sites. Ritually following such routes can be a means to manifesting magical power toward a particular purpose, though [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] notes that it is often not a matter of commanding such power, so much as being caught up in it.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] decides to take the seat for his own interpretation of the experience, and feels resonances with his own past, as do [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]. They note that according to their map, the magical line of force to the north appears to pass over [[Places-of-Asterion#Mount Orpheus|Mount Orpheus]], as well as a point on [[Dramatis-Personae#Baron Astorg of Payr|Baron Astorg's]] map marked simply as "Goblins? Dragon?" The group wonders about the possible significance of all this geography to [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]], and resolves to make their way north, though first to trace that path through [[Places-of-Asterion#Lake Terror|Lake Terror]] itself, in search of its legendary bell.

## The Bell in the Lake

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] enters the water with [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]], feeling their way along the bottom. They note some odd and unpleasant "flavors" to the water, unsurprising given its reputation for emitting sulfurous scents. Creeping along the bottom, and a depth of perhaps 90 yards, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] encounters a hard, curved object, with a strong aura of magic.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] feels out the edges of the mysterious object, noting its deeply pocketed surface, slimy coating of algae, and substantial mass for its size. As he tries to shift it on the lake bottom, he becomes aware of a prickling sensation on his hands, and a growing numbness and weakness spreading from them. He ultimately casts a Frostbite spell, which alleviates the discomfort and generates a mass of ice on his arms from which he breaks free with some difficulty.

He returns to shore and describes his experience. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] notes seeing an object floating over the center of the lake, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] walks on water to recover it, identifying it as a hazardous, but not especially unusual, flesh-eating ooze that was easily dispatched by the frost attack. But the group remains puzzled why [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] didn't persist after dealing with the threat to recover the magical object. Persuaded, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] retraces his steps on the lake bottom. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] uses his mysterious senses to see through the water, and notes that while the lake contains a thicket of sunken trees and branches, and a couple of rotten boats, there appears to be no sign of a village at all. Nevertheless, after a bit of groping in the murk, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] slowly trudges back to shore with a gnarled 100lb mass of enchanted iron that seems to function as a 27 point Powerstone.

## Following the Path of Retribution

After brief discussion, the adventurers resolve to follow the magical "Ley Line" to [[Places-of-Asterion#Mount Orpheus|Mount Orpheus]], investigating the alleged site of "goblins?" and "dragon?" enroute. They camp early in the woods by the [[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|"Devil's Seat"]] to catch up on missed rest, and head north following highland trails on the morning of Wednesday, the 10th. In the late morning they spy a large creature in flight up ahead, which [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] discerns as having bat-like wings, making leisurely arcs but ultimately keeping many miles away.

By late afternoon the trail has climbed up into a new range of hills, and begun to follow a deep gorge. As the sun grows low, the adventurers can see a rope bridge spanning the gorge from a cave in the mountainside, and considers whether to explore it, or alter their course to avoid it. They deviate from the trail, aiming to give the bridge a wide berth, but become aware of a scouting party of five warg-mounted goblins. They conceal themselves among rocks, but the goblins seem to note, by scent or sound, the presence of [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], and charge him.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] is just as happy to stand his ground against the attack, rather than shrink from hated goblins, and he and his comrades are able to loose a volley of arrows, axes, and a bolt of lightning as the savages close. The goblins have no chance to reconsider before melee is joined, and they and their mounts are swiftly slaughtered, and ears collected.

## The Ancient Statues

The heroes pause to heal wounds and consider whether the noise of the clash was noted by other goblins. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], however, has grown mildly obsessed with the yawning depth of the gorge – perhaps the highest precipice she can recall seeing – and resolves to walk the suspension cable. Noting that the magical "path" they're tracing corresponds more closely to the bridge and cave than to the path they've been following, they resolve to support her reconnaissance.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] mounts one of the cables and scampers along it into the cave mouth, seeing no activity, but noting that the cave is lined with weathered alabaster statues of androgynous, vaguely elf-featured figures, each about 10-12' tall. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] cross the bridge in more conventional fashion pretty close behind her, followed by the rest of the group (though [[Dramatis-Personae#Puddin'|Puddin']], [[Dramatis-Personae#Bobby the Burro|Bobby the burro]], and the cart are left at a concealed bivouac just off the trail). None in the party can closely identify the style or subjects of the statuary, though they give the impression of noble figures, whatever their specific race or history.

The adventurers descend cautiously into the dark -- [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] at the lead, less inconvenienced by the dark, while the rest hang back, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] with a torch in hand. They count 26 statues as they advance, with minimal signs of life other than bats and bugs, though the stench of goblins and wargs is heavy in the air for those attuned to such things.

About 100 yards in, the cave passage opens into a vertical shaft, stretching up and down into darkness. Another suspension bridge spans this shaft, and the sound of rushing, falling water echoes through it. A heavy crusting of guano on the bridge indicates an even heavier population of bats above.

The chamber across the bridge is about 50 yards deep, with water flowing down a series of tiered pools on either side. At the bottom water trickles onto the chamber floor, converging into a stream that precipitates into the abyss. A few stools, buckets, and simple tools lay strewn randomly about.

Directly across from the bridge, a reinforced tunnel, suggestive of a mine, stretches on still further. The air at its mouth smells strongly of rock and metal and wargs.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] shapes the earth around the tunnel into a wall of rock a couple feet thick to seal off any threats while the adventurers plan what or whether to explore further – They consider a tunnel sloping upward, the apparent source of the waterfall on their right, or a path that leads down, winding around the inner surface of the shaft they first crossed. Before they settle on a course of action, however, they hear loud splashing from the waterfall tunnel. Readying for action, they are nonetheless shocked to see five nine-foot trolls striding down the tiered falls to attack.

*As the massive trolls descended the tiered waterfalls toward them, the companions knew they had discovered something significant. The [[Places-of-Asterion#Devil's Chair|Devil's Chair]] and its ley line of vengeance, the ancient alabaster statues, and now this cave complex all seemed connected to the mysteries they sought. Whether this was where [[Dramatis-Personae#Aramaina Faelandaerl|Aramaina]] had her transformative experience, or merely another waypoint on her journey, the path of retribution was leading them deeper into the heart of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills']] most guarded secrets.*
