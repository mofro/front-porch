# 2025-08-30 Asterion Log
*Original Date: August 30, 2025*
*Session Twenty: Rescuing Gliressë*

## Summary
The companions travel to [[Places-of-Asterion#Bort|Bort]] to resupply and investigate the mysterious [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#The Bloodleash|Bloodleash]] harpoon. After learning its dark history from [[Dramatis-Personae#Brother Fulton|Brother Fulton]], they return to the [[Places-of-Asterion#Rope Bridge Cave|rope bridge cave]] to rescue the elven princess [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]]. However, they discover she has been transformed into a monstrous spider creature who lures them into her web-filled lair. After a fierce battle, they defeat the [[Dramatis-Personae#Spider Princess|Spider Princess]] and claim a substantial magical treasure hoard.

## Chapter 21 – Rescuing Gliressë

### Arrival at Bort
The adventurers set out for [[Places-of-Asterion#Bort|Bort]] on the morning of Friday the 12th, arriving at mid-afternoon. The setting sun highlights the 250' basaltic cliffs known as "[[Places-of-Asterion#The Pipe Organ|The Pipe Organ]]" that overlook the town from the east. They bid farewell to the rescued prisoners and scatter through the town on their own various quests.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] finds that the town has a dwarf smith by the name of [[Dramatis-Personae#Abrum|Abrum]], and negotiates the creation of some armor using the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Wyvern Scales|wyvern scales]], with the unused scales kept by [[Dramatis-Personae#Abrum|Abrum]] as payment.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] locate an inn to provide a performance venue and group accommodations.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] investigates other taverns for news and looks for deserving indigents to "reverse pickpocket" – leaving them with anonymous donations of silver. In addition rumors familiar from past eavesdropping, she notes a couple of claims that some goblin raiding bands in the [[Places-of-Asterion#Smoking Hills|Smoking Hills]] may be led by orcs. She mentions this to [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]], but none of the rumors seem to have much detail behind them – all seem to be the tales of "friends of friends".

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] visits the abbey and church of [[Places-of-Asterion#Sts. Germain of Byzantium and Remedy of Wapicum|Sts. Germain of Byzantium and Remedy of Wapicum]], a fairly extensive operation, sponsored by the abbey of [[Places-of-Asterion#Lealand|Lealand]] in the east, that effectively runs most of the town. He seeks access to the Abbey's library, but finds that cooperation soon evaporates. He believes that his inquiries may have reached someone in the abbey hierarchy who knows of his excommunicate status, and forbade cooperation.

### The Bloodleash Investigation
The next day, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] decides to investigate a small priory in the suburban hamlet of [[Places-of-Asterion#God's Gate|God's Gate]]. The leadership here proves either less well-informed or more tolerant, and he is directed to [[Dramatis-Personae#Brother Fulton|Brother Fulton]], an antiquarian and steward of the priory's modest library. While the library is disappointing in terms of its overall resources, [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] shows [[Dramatis-Personae#Brother Fulton|Fulton]] the harpoon used to slay the wyvern, and the cleric scurries through stacks of ledgers and scrolls.

He finds the references he recalled to a weapon known as "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#The Bloodleash|The Bloodleash]]", which was observed in [[Places-of-Asterion#Bort|Bort]] some 50 years prior, in the possession of a mercenary hunting goblin raiders for the bounty money. It is said to allow the wielder to cast a Command spell against any victim in which it has embedded and drawn blood.

Supposedly the mercenary had purchased [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#The Bloodleash|The Bloodleash]] from an unnamed dwarf, said to have been maimed, disgraced, and seeking funding for some ongoing blood feud in the dwarven cities of the [[Places-of-Asterion#White Mountains|White Mountains]]. [[Dramatis-Personae#Brother Fulton|Fulton]] points out distinctive writing ornamentally scrolled along the dragonbone shaft of the weapon, which he can only partially decipher as an extremely archaic Elven script. The dwarf, supposedly claimed that it had been obtained by a relative some centuries prior, from some foe "from deeper than the dwarves generally go".

### Return to the Cave
When [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] returns to the group that evening, they discuss whether to return to the cave at once in response to [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]]'s pleas, or to wait for the completion of the wyvern armor and for the "[[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Bell of Bess|Bell of Bess]]" powerstone to recharge. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s curiosity and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]]'s prejudice in favor of action tip the scales, and the party sets out for the cave on the morning of Sunday, August 14. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] magically erects a stone "chimney" to conceal [[Dramatis-Personae#Bobby the Burro|Bobby]] and the cart, and they cautiously approach the cave entrance.

Finding the rope bridge still standing, [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] crosses it hand over hand from below, followed by the rest of the party in more conventional fashion once she signals the way clear.

### Exploring the Wyvern's Lair
The adventurers descend to the second bridge, crossing it to arrive in the waterfall chamber, and find no sign of goblins or other inhabitants, alive or dead, though the reek of them and their wargs remains. They decide to first explore the passage up the waterfalls, from which the trolls attacked previously. They encounter several meandering dead end side passages, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Quia|Quia]] expediting matters by scouting ahead. Finally reaching what [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] recalls to have been the passage where she turned back upon encountering what they presume to have been the wyvern, they at last enter the chamber, finding no living thing, but a scattering of scat, and a few shiny items – a brass astrolabe... an empty and unstoppered crystal decanter... a tarnished silver belt buckle embossed with a lion's face, and a brass hand, with leather straps implying use as a prosthesis, and its fingers curved in a fashion that could perhaps loosely grasp or hook objects.

The ceiling of the chamber is high and empty, with hints of light from further above, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] scales it to find that it winds about, with sufficient width for this to have been the wyvern's access to its lair below. A sinkhole leads to the surface, and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] looks out over the stirring vistas of the [[Places-of-Asterion#Averny Valley|Averny valley]], and the looming [[Places-of-Asterion#Mount Orpheus|Mount Orpheus]] to the northeast.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] returns to her comrades, and they continue to explore up the main watercourse, eventually crossing a broad fault in the mountain and coming to a stop at a deep shaft. About 90' up the wall of the shaft, a carved monstrous humanoid face spews water from its mouth as the source of the watercourse. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] scampers up this shaft as well, eventually finding another sinkhole to the mountain surface.

### The Mine Works
The adventurers return to the "waterfall room", and decide to further explore the mineworks where they found the prisoners. They cautiously work their way down the tunnels, with [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] noting that the rock seems to be of the sort favored for mining gold, and sometimes garnet stones. There are traces of fairly ancient excavation, with sporadic signs of more recent digging of the sort described by [[Dramatis-Personae#Alinor|Alinor]] as having been done by prisoners under goblin coercion.

The tunnels form a generally circular pattern and the group works through its various rings, finally coming upon an apparent storeroom perhaps 1,500' back from the cave entrance. Various chunks of smoked or salted meat of unknown provenance hang from the ceiling, which the heroes unanimously decide to forgo, but they collect various other potentially useful items – 6 bolts of wool cloth (@6lbs), 3 bolts of linen cloth (@2.5lbs), 1 cask of beeswax (10lbs), 1 small keg of emery powder (2lbs), a steelyard scale (cap. 300lbs, 20lbs), 2 pickaxes (@8lbs), and a small keg of nails (10d, 3lbs).

### Gliressë's Voice
As the heroes work their way back through the arc of tunnels, occasional scurrying sounds and fragmentary whispers echo through the dark. Even [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] struggles make out much detail, until ultimately a soft voice fills his head – "You have returned for me?"

"Not sure... Where are you?" he replies.

"I'm further down. The Goblins seem to have withdrawn" the voice continues.

"If the goblins have withdrawn what help do you need? [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] probes as the group continues its search.

"I am trapped here. In gossamer bonds. I need your help to break them."

The cryptic reply leads [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] to take his time in further dialog, wanting the group's exploration to continue at its own pace, and suspicious of the voice's intent. But before long the voice resumes, still soft, but somewhat more stressed. "Don't Delay! They may return!"

After another long pause – "Please... Come back down... You're so close, and they are fleeing."

"We are searching" replies [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]].

"Go back to the bridges. I am across the next bridge below." the voice directs.

### Descent to the Spider's Lair
As the group at last returns to the "waterfall room", and descends, the voice expresses relief – "Thank goodness! Keep going across the water. There will be a gulf across a waterfall. Cross that however you can."

The adventurers wind down around the shaft that yawns beneath the second bridge. This path too appears to have been scoured of dead, including the staff-wielding leader sniped by [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]. They bypass a major side passage which has many goblin tracks, in favor of the less traveled path down. Finally they cross a third bridge, some 200' below the second, and continue down a narrow cave tunnel.

It opens into a large cavern some 200' across, filled with tiered pools of overflowing water similar to those of the "waterfall room", but broader and flowing at a more leisurely pace. The depth of the pools varies considerably, and the party continues down a dry path between the two main watercourses. The chamber comes to an abrupt and precipitous end, with the water streaming into another dark abyss.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] perceive that the drop is only about 40' to another body of water, and that the lower pool has a beach of sorts to one side. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] is able to wade over to one wall of the cavern and climb down to set up a rope to help the others descend. They do so in turn, though there is a moment of panic when [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], reluctant to climb down the rope, jokingly suggests that [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] throw him down. The giant highlander takes him at his word, and scoops him up accordingly. Fortunately a panicked [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] is able to dissuade him before the toss.

### The Spider Princess Revealed
The group follows the beach around the lake, and crosses streams of water trickling down from another body of water above. A path leads up alongside this natural cistern, and the heroes ascend, but note menacingly dense cobwebs trailing down from above – some gauzy, others thick as rope. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], walking point, spies a glittering pile of gold, silver, and other items ahead but, suspicious, does not speak of it. A voice, soft but clear, again gushes in [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]]'s head – "Thank goodness you have arrived at last!"

The adventurers scan the cavern as they creep forward, [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] with their enhanced senses, and the rest struggling by the light of [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]]' single torch, as he begins to charge a lightning bolt. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] presses the voice: "Where are you? How are we supposed to free you?" He hears faint vibrations singing through the webs, but cannot localize them, and hesitates to speed his advance.

"A bit further back... So close..." sighs the voice, coyly.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], her attention focused in the webs above, thinks she might see a large shadow slipping forward through them. Feeling her suspicions confirmed, she sneers, "Nice webs, [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]]... Are they yours?" while knocking an arrow. Suddenly a thick web whips down to narrowly miss [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] and rebound with a handful of adhering gravel. As the half-elf attempts a countershot, however, the bowstring strikes her wrist and sends the arrow tumbling uselessly.

### Battle with the Spider Princess
The rest of the heroes search the webs and darkness to no avail, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] spots the warmth from which the "fishing line" originated and his crossbow shot seems to strike true. Yet the dwarf is shocked when his bolt rebounds in an instant and strikes his shoulder. "You're all terribly rude" whispers the voice, now audible to all, in a disgusted tone.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] at last spies the shape above – the size of a draft horse, though he can discern no details. He looses his lightning at their attacker. The dazzling flash briefly illuminates the massive spidery form of the assailant, but this bolt rebounds as did [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s, and to even greater affect, leaving [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] in a smoking heap alongside a torch now fully engulfed in flames.

The "fishing line" whips down again, striking [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] squarely and reeling him helplessly back up into the webs. The spell caster is treated to a horrifying close encounter with [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]] – huge, hairy, and glossy black with metallic blue-green streaks. Her nimble legs, claws, and pedipalps draw him close to her grotesque face, with its huge dripping fangs and far too many eyes – most a deep and soulless black, but the two largest a disconcertingly beautiful sea green in color, with luxurious lashes. A delicate leafy tiara, reflecting the dim torchlight with the ghostly blue-silver glow of mithril, sits atop her head. [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] briefly attempts a scream, which is quickly cut off by his convulsive retching.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]] react at once – the former magically igniting a fire in the gauziest overhead webs, and the latter scampering up the wall of the cave in an attempt to engage the foe hand-to-hand. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] charges closer on the ground, hoping to leap within sword reach, but [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] calls out to him for a boost. The highlander links his hands into a stirrup, and flings the leaping half-elf up into the flaming webs before raising his own sword to join the attack.

But as the adventurers converge on the [[Dramatis-Personae#Spider Princess|Spider Princess]] under a canopy of fire she proves elusive in spite of her bulk. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] slashes with his mighty sword, only for the spider to suddenly vanish with a "POP" and appear on the ground yards behind him. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]], previously unable to join the aerial fray, finds [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]] now within reach, and charges with his hammer, though her tough exoskeleton shrugs off his first blow.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] plays songs to heal the wounded, while [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] reconsiders his strategy, noting with dismay that some of the rock structures he had assumed were supporting the webs are, in fact, loose boulders suspended in them, and now giving way as the webs burn.

[[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] has returned to slash repeatedly at [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]], but she deflects his blade with her formidably armored limbs, and rakes him with one of her claws, though he avoids her vicious fangs. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]]'s hammer at last strikes true, though, landing a solid blow between her thorax and abdomen that seems to stun her. [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]] follows up with fierce strikes that split her carapace and spew blue-green ichor, yet she does not fall.

The rest of the heroes scramble to press the advantage. [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]], and [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] in turn vault from the flaming webs attempting to land finishing blows, but none can quite land a square or penetrating hit. Finally, it is [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] whose hammer pick strikes home on a gap in the spider's shell, and her foul bulk collapses in a heap.

### The Treasure Hoard
[[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] returns to healing [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]], who, once ambulatory, is able to heal [[Dramatis-Personae#Ahira|Ahira]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Ferguson MacJayne|MacJayne]]'s injuries. [[Dramatis-Personae#Vidocq|Vidocq]] and [[Dramatis-Personae#Jos|Jos]], followed by the rest, investigate the glittering apparent treasure pile at the center of the chamber, noting that while there are a substantial number of gold and silver coins, they have been painstakingly arranged to cover a pile of rocks and sand 5' in diameter and 2½' tall, to create the impression of a vastly larger horde. In total, the treasure consists of:

*With the [[Dramatis-Personae#Spider Princess|Spider Princess]] defeated and her treasure claimed, the companions have cleared another major threat from the [[Places-of-Asterion#Rope Bridge Cave|rope bridge cave system]]. The substantial magical hoard suggests [[Dramatis-Personae#Gliressë|Gliressë]] had been collecting treasures for some time, possibly from previous adventurers who fell victim to her web. The party now faces decisions about how to distribute the wealth and whether to continue exploring the extensive cave network or return to pursue other leads in their quest for the [[Artifacts-&-Treasures#Veil of Elphame|Veil of Elphame]].*
