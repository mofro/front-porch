## Chronicle II: The Descent Beneath Lutetia
*From the Journal of [[Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] Thatch, Scholar and Mage*

**Anno Domini 1216, May**

What manner of Providence guided us to that accursed key, I shall never know. The very foundations of Lutetia conceal secrets darker than any tax collector's ledger, as we discovered when Jos's mysterious commission led us into the bowels of the Great Keep itself.

The key—retrieved from Lucky Pete's gullet at such cost—proved true to Hanmer's word, opening a forgotten door in the river levee. What followed was a descent into nightmare that I record here lest memory fail me in years to come. The narrow passage gave way to vaulted chambers where darkness pressed against our feeble torches like a living thing.

The rats came first—not the common vermin of any city, but creatures organized with malevolent intelligence. They swarmed us in waves while their larger kin, the sword-bearing ratmen, struck from above. I still recall the acid spray of my spells mixing with MacJayne's blood as the beasts gnawed at him like some barbaric delicacy.

Yet it was not the rats that proved most significant, but what we found in that moldering chest: 4,000 copper coins of uncertain vintage, and more importantly, a vellum scroll. Written in Latin, it proved to be a Volcian property deed—establishing title to lands near Aurelian, bounded by "an alleged Carnute tomb."

Providence, indeed. For while we sought treasure in those depths, what we truly found was purpose—our first glimpse of the ancient mysteries that would soon consume our lives.

Little did we know that this descent beneath Lutetia was but the first step on a path that would lead us through the length and breadth of Gallia, in pursuit of secrets that kings and queens had died to possess.

## Chronicle III: The Shadows of Wassford
*As told by Colthan the Grey to his young charges*

**Summer of 1216**

Gather 'round, little ones, and I'll tell you how our Jos came back to Wassford with giants and wizards in tow, and how she struck the first blow against the Child Breakers—those monsters who would steal childhood itself for profit.

You see, there are evils in this world that wear the faces of men, but whose hearts are blacker than any demon's. Such were the Child Breakers, who would take orphaned children and... well, little ones should not hear such details. Suffice it to say they would twist young bodies to make them better beggars, then sell them to crime bosses like chattel.

But Jos—ah, my brave Jos!—she would not stand for such wickedness. When she learned from me of Hanmer's dealings with these creatures, she and her companions vowed to see justice done. The trail led them to young Andre, poor lad, whose hands and feet had been transformed to flippers by dark arts.

Following the boy's tale, they ventured into the High Fens, to that accursed fortress where evil made its nest. What they found there was an orc shaman—imagine that! An orc, here in civilized Gallia!—commanding ogres and goblins in service to the Breakers' cause.

The battle was fierce, they tell me. MacJayne's own sword-arm turned against him by foul magic, while [[Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] fought with spell-fire and Ahira's hammer rang like a bell of doom. But evil cannot stand against righteous fury, and when the smoke cleared, the Breakers' fortress was naught but ash and memory.

Baron Matthias himself—the very man who slew Queen Aramaina!—praised their deed and saw the villains hanged. Justice was served, children were saved, and my Jos... well, she learned that some fights are worth fighting, no matter the cost.

*Remember that, little ones. Remember it well.*

## Chronicle IV: The Tomb of the Demon King
*From the Chronicles of Professore Miguel de Patavium, University of Lutetia*

**Anno Domini 1216, Midsummer**

The Volcian deed led them true—those remarkable adventurers who have become the talk of scholarly circles throughout Gallia. Where ancient maps marked only forest, they found the standing stones that once bounded the estate of Lucius Calibus Ventis, and beneath those stones, a tomb that predated Roman conquest by centuries untold.

I must confess, dear readers, that my academic composure was quite shattered when they returned with rubbings of the carvings within. The swirling patterns speak of artistic traditions utterly foreign to known Celtic work—something far older, and far more disturbing.

But it was not mere academic curiosity that drove them into those depths. The sealed chamber held guardians both spectral and material: a massive black hound that erupted into ash when struck, only to reform elsewhere, and a shadow-thing that dwelt within an ancient trunk, reaching out with tendrils of living darkness.

Yet these were but the antechamber to greater horrors. In the tomb's heart lay stone sarcophagi, and from these emerged warriors of bone, their remains inscribed with runes of power that chilled the very soul. The battle was desperate—Rupus speaks of a draining cold that sapped their very life force as they fought.

But the true revelation came when they descended to the tomb's deepest level, following passages revealed only after they had burned the headless queen's remains. There, in silver-lined chambers, waited the tomb's true lord—a vampire chief of such antiquity that even death had not released his hold upon this world.

The artifacts they recovered speak to a civilization of which we know nothing—weapons of meteoric iron, armor that predates known metallurgy, and most mysterious of all, an oracular device of elven make that casts shadows to divine the future.

What manner of kingdom once ruled these lands? What connections link this ancient tomb to the more recent tragedy of Queen Aramaina? These questions haunt me still, for I fear the companions have uncovered but the first thread of a tapestry whose full pattern may prove too terrible to comprehend.

## Chronicle V: The Necromancer's Dance
*Being the Last Testament of Brother Aldric, Found Among His Effects*

**In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.**

I write these words knowing they may be my last, for I have seen with my own eyes the abomination that stalks the roads near Stamp, and I fear my soul is forfeit for what I have witnessed.

The dead walk, my brothers. Not in metaphor or parable, but in terrible truth. Ursula the dancing bear, who once brought joy to children's faces, now shambles through the meadows with decay hanging from her bones like festering garlands. The troupe of performers we welcomed to our village—men, women, children who laughed and sang but days ago—now serve as puppets to a madman who has traded his soul for dominion over death itself.

But blessed be the Lord, for He has sent champions against this evil. Six companions came upon the meadow of the damned, and though one among them swooned at the sight (and who could blame him?), the others fought with the fury of avenging angels. Arrows flew true, blades sang their deadly songs, and spell-fire cleansed the very air of corruption.

The Necromancer himself—a mountbank fortune-teller who had dabbled in arts no Christian soul should name—fell to elven archery, his circus of horrors crumbling to ash as his unholy life ended. They found among his effects tools of dark alchemy and scrolls I dare not describe, for some knowledge is too perilous for mortal minds.

I watched from afar as the mage among them—Rupus, they called him—spoke words of power and returned the defiled earth to sanctity, burying the abominations where they could trouble the world no more.

Yet even as I write these words of thanksgiving, I am troubled. For if such evil can take root in our peaceful countryside, what greater darkness stirs in the world's hidden places? What malevolent will guides these events?

Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

## Chronicle VI: The Silver Sarcophagus
*A Knight's Tale, as Recorded by Sir Gareth of Brittany*

**Year of Our Lord 1216**

By my sword and by my honor, I swear that what I here set down is true, though it strain the very bounds of credibility. For I have spoken with the companions themselves, and seen with my own eyes the wealth they bore from that accursed tomb—wealth enough to ransom kings, yet purchased at a price that makes me glad I followed the banner to distant shores rather than seek fortune in Gallia's haunted earth.

When the burning of the Queen's bones revealed new passages in that ancient sepulcher, the companions descended once more into darkness—but this time, they found a tomb within a tomb, chambers that predated the first burial by centuries uncounted. Here lay the funeral treasures of some barbarian chief whose very name has been lost to time: copper ingots of impossible size, weapons and armor that sang with eldritch power, and gemstones that gleamed with their own inner light.

But the greatest prize lay in that massive sarcophagus of silver—a fortune in precious metal that could purchase entire counties. Yet its contents proved more valuable still, and infinitely more dangerous. For within that silver shell lay the Demon King himself, the vampire lord who had ruled these lands in ages past.

MacJayne speaks little of that final battle, but I have seen the scars that mark him still—wounds that run deeper than flesh, for they were dealt by claws that had tasted the blood of generations. Ahira's hammer, blessed with silver and sanctified wood, rang like a church bell as it struck home. Rupus's spells turned the very water of the burial pool into weapons of cleansing.

When the vampire crumbled to ash, the companions found themselves masters of wealth beyond imagining—silver enough to build cathedrals, weapons that had drunk the blood of forgotten wars, and artifacts whose true power may never be fully understood.

Yet even as they counted their treasure, I wonder if they truly comprehended what they had unleashed. For in destroying that ancient evil, had they also broken some fell compact that had kept greater darkness at bay? Time alone will tell.

## Chronicle VII: The Road to Glory and Shadow
*From the Memoirs of Lord Lithlaeron Oryathar, Ambassador Extraordinary*

**Midsummer, 1216**

Duty compelled me to seek them out—these unlikely heroes whose exploits had begun to reach even the refined ears of the High Court. Queen Mother Bianca herself had commanded that contributions be gathered for King Ludovic's ransom, and intelligence suggested that a certain band of adventurers had recently come into possession of significant wealth.

I found them at the University, consulting with that earnest scholar Miguel de Patavium about their latest discoveries. Six figures huddled over ancient texts and gleaming artifacts—a collection of races and temperaments that would have been remarkable in any age, but seemed almost prophetic in those troubled times.

The blind seer Vidocq possessed an uncanny awareness that made even my elven senses seem dull by comparison. The dwarf Ahira bore himself with the solid dignity of his people, while the Highland barbarian MacJayne radiated a barely contained violence that spoke of battlefields yet to come. The mage [[Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] combined scholarly precision with arcane power in equal measure, and the minstrel [[Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] brought a lightness to their fellowship that belied the darkness they had already faced.

But it was the elf-maid Jos who intrigued me most—young by our standards, yet already marked by experiences that would age a human lifetime. In her eyes, I saw both the fire of her ancestors and something else: a purpose that transcended mere adventure or wealth.

They agreed to the Queen Mother's request, though I sensed their reluctance. Ten thousand silver marks—a princely sum that they parted with as easily as a merchant might pay for bread. Such casual generosity spoke either of vast wealth or profound foolishness, though I suspect it was neither.

As I departed with their contribution and the sealed document that would mark them as friends to the Crown, I found myself wondering what manner of destiny drew such disparate souls together. For in my long years serving the courts of both men and elves, I have learned to recognize the touch of fate when I see it.

These companions were no mere treasure-seekers. They were players in a game whose rules had been set in motion long before any of us drew breath—a game whose final moves would determine the very shape of the world to come.

## Chronicle VIII: The Bandit Queen's Masque
*A Minstrel's Memory, Set to Verse and Song*

Listen well, you lords and ladies fair,  
To tales of magic in the evening air,  
When Nierynwen, the Bandit Queen,  
Danced to music fit for Elphame's screen.

In Ligerkilns' humble roadside inn,  
Where honest folk seek rest within,  
There came a lady, old and bent,  
But moving as if heaven-sent.

Young [[Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] played his hurdy-gurdy sweet,  
While the strange woman danced on nimble feet,  
But mark you well what next transpired—  
The crone's true form was soon revealed!

From aged hag to maiden fair,  
With raven locks and skin so rare,  
She danced and spun with elven grace,  
While glamour wreathed around that place.

The walls grew bright with jeweled light,  
As if the hall were fairyland bright,  
But Jos the keen of elven eye  
Saw through the spell and magic lie.

With Selfish Scribe she marked the boy,  
The cupbearer in Nierynwen's employ,  
A scar that only she could see—  
A hunter's mark for all to be.

Then warning came from loyal band,  
That mortal law was close at hand,  
The spell was broken, magic fled,  
And Nierynwen's troupe away was led.

But ere she left, she spoke these words  
That ring more true than song of birds:  
"Perhaps we all can play one day,  
When darker powers come to fray."

*What meant she by this cryptic verse?  
What greater plot for good or worse?  
The minstrel knows, but dare not tell—  
Some secrets serve both heaven and hell.*

## Chronicle IX: The Capture of Astaragat's Tower
*From the Official Report to Countess Alix of Ludonum*

**To Her Most Noble Ladyship, Countess Alix of Ludonum**  
**From Vidocq, Knight-Errant, and Company**

Your Ladyship,

It is with great satisfaction that we report the successful completion of your commission to investigate and secure the Abode of Chaos, that ancient fortress which has long commanded the heights above your fair city.

We found the tower much as rumored—abandoned these hundred years, yet strangely preserved, as if time itself had been held at bay by arcane forces. The outer defenses proved minimal, though what lay within tested our resolve to its very limits.

The tower's lower chambers harbored giant frogs of venomous aspect, while the upper levels contained guardians both mechanical and mystical. Statues of living stone defended chambers filled with alchemical apparatus, and creatures of living shadow struck from unexpected quarters. Most challenging of all was the great Liver—a floating abomination that commanded lightning and sought to drain the very life from our bones.

The tower's original master, the wizard Astaragat, had long since departed for destinations unknown, leaving only a miniature homunculus to guard his secrets. This artificial guardian commanded the tower's defenses through invisible eyes and malevolent will, but fell to superior tactics and righteous determination.

We found extensive libraries of arcane knowledge, laboratories equipped with apparatus of remarkable sophistication, and artifacts whose full power may require years to comprehend. All told, the tower represents a repository of magical learning that should prove invaluable to any lord wise enough to claim it.

The threat that has so long plagued your lands has been eliminated. The Abode of Chaos stands ready to serve as fortress, residence, or center of learning, as Your Ladyship sees fit.

Your Humble Servants,  
Vidocq and the Company of Six

## Chronicle X: The Basilisk's Last Hunt
*Being an Extract from "De Monstris et Mirabilibus" by Brother Thomas*

**Of the Basilisk and its Vanquishing**

Know, gentle reader, that among the most terrible of God's creatures—whether created for His inscrutable purposes or spawned by the Enemy's malice—few inspire such dread as the Basilisk. This serpent, whose very gaze transforms living flesh to stone, had made its lair in the courtyard of Astaragat's tower, and there it had dwelt for decades untold.

The companions, having cleansed the tower's interior of its mystical guardians, thought their labors complete. Yet when MacJayne and [[Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] ventured into the sunlit courtyard, they came face to face with the King of Serpents itself—sixty feet of scaled horror, with a rooster's head crowned by sickle antlers, and eyes that meant instant death to any who looked upon them.

The warriors' eyes burned and wept at the mere sight of the beast, their hearts racing as if to burst from their chests. They fled back to the tower's safety, but the Basilisk's roar shook the very stones, and its presence corrupted the air itself with the stench of ancient venom.

What followed speaks to the strange mercy of Divine Providence, for the mage Rupus—declaring the creature an abomination in the sight of God—worked such magic as turned the Basilisk's own flesh to ice. Whether this was righteous judgment or dangerous precedent, I leave to wiser heads than mine to determine.

Yet the deed was done, and the ancient menace laid to rest. The Abode of Chaos stood truly cleansed, ready to serve the cause of civilization once more.

*Nota Bene: The author has heard tell that some few creatures of such power cannot be truly slain, but only bound or transformed. Whether the Basilisk truly died, or merely slumbers in bonds of ice and earth, remains to be seen.*

## Chronicle XI: The Forest of Stone
*From the Personal Journal of Pallikari the Centaur*

**Written in the Common Tongue for Those Who Would Remember**

Two hundred years I have walked the green roads of this world, and in all that time I have never known terror such as I felt in the Forest of Stone. Not even in the darkest days of Aramaina's war, when elf fought elf and the very earth seemed to bleed, did I feel such hopeless dread.

I had come seeking my old friend Corin Quickpath, believing him to be somewhere in that accursed place. The rumors spoke of a gorgon named Kakeńdrixris, and I thought perhaps Corin had come to face her—either to claim some treasure she guarded, or to hide some precious thing where none would dare to seek it.

What I found instead was a kingdom of statues—not carved by any sculptor's hand, but once-living beings transformed by the gorgon's deadly gaze into eternal monuments to their own folly. Trees, beasts, men, and elves, all turned to stone in the moment of their doom.

The gorgon herself was ancient beyond measure, her serpentine coils thick as tree trunks, her sword keen enough to cleave armor like parchment. But it was her eyes—those terrible, all-seeing eyes—that were her truest weapon. One glance meant transformation, life become lifeless stone in the space between heartbeats.

I felt the change begin even as I tried to turn away, the creeping coldness that starts in the extremities and works inward toward the heart. My last memory was of hooves that no longer felt the earth beneath them, and the growing weight of stone flesh that could no longer carry the spirit within.

Ten years I stood thus, aware but unable to move, watching the seasons change through eyes that could no longer blink. I saw other seekers come and fall to the same fate—warriors and scholars, treasure-hunters and pilgrims, all joining the gorgon's silent court.

Until the six companions came, armed with mirrors and determination, and blessed with both courage and cunning enough to face what could not be faced directly. They freed me from my stone prison, and for that I owe them a debt that spans lifetimes.

But of Corin Quickpath, I found no sign. Whether he never came to this place, or whether his statue crumbled to dust in the decade of my imprisonment, I cannot say. The search continues, though I fear it may prove as endless as the gorgon's malice was deep.

## Chronicle XII: The Veil's Shadow
*Being the Final Entry in This Chronicle*

And so we come to the end of this portion of our tale, though the greater story continues still. The companions have grown from chance-met strangers into a fellowship bound by shared peril and common purpose. They have delved into forgotten tombs, faced creatures of nightmare, and amassed both wealth and wisdom in equal measure.

Yet for all their victories, the greatest mystery remains unsolved. The Veil of Elphame—that legendary armor which made Queen Aramaina invincible until the hour of her death—has not been found. Was it truly taken by the scout Corin Quickpath? Does it lie hidden in some secret cache, waiting for another to claim its power? Or has it passed beyond the reach of mortal hands entirely?

The companions know that others seek the Veil as well. The bandit queen Nierynwen, who claims to be Aramaina's lost daughter, surely hunts for her supposed inheritance. The High Elves of the Celestial Realm watch and wait with interests known only to themselves. And in the shadows, older powers stir—powers that remember when the world was young and magic flowed like rivers through the land.

Our heroes have set their faces toward the Smoking Hills, where Aramaina first found the Veil in the depths of her wandering. What they will find there—allies or enemies, answers or only deeper mysteries—remains to be written in the great book of fate.

But this much is certain: the age of quiet grows short. The old powers wake, the ancient compacts weaken, and across the length and breadth of Asterion, the pieces move upon a board whose final game will determine the fate of all who dwell beneath the sun.

The chronicles end here, but the story... the story has only just begun.

*—Sealed and witnessed this day*

**Thus conclude the Chronicles of the Companions, First Cycle**  
**Let all who read these words remember:**  
**That courage is not the absence of fear, but action in its presence**  
**That fellowship is forged in fire and tempered by trial**  
**And that even the smallest light may drive back the greatest darkness**
