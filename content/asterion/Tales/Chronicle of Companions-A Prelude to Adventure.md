In the twilight days of the Age of Faith, when steel-clad knights still rode forth in the name of distant kings and shadows of ancient magic lingered in the forgotten corners of Asterion, our tale begins. This is the chronicle of an unlikely fellowship, bound not by oaths or blood, but by chance, circumstance, and perhaps the unseen hand of destiny.

The year is 1216 Anno Domini, in the Kingdom of Gallia, where the echoes of old Volcian glory mingle with the ambitions of feudal lords. King Ludovic leads a crusade in distant Aegypt, while in the streets of Lutetia, the great city on the river Sequana, power flows like murky water through the hands of those who claim it.

Our chronicle opens with a chance meeting on Falcon Hill, where the gibbet stands as a grim reminder of royal justice. There, a towering barbarian warrior from the northern highlands, Ferguson MacJayne, his massive claymore strapped across his broad back, observes a lithe figure climbing the scaffold. The figure is Jos, an elven rogue of uncommon skill, attempting to recover a key from the corpse of "Lucky Pete," a thief who had swallowed his most valuable possession before his date with the hangman.

When a guard interrupts Jos's grim task, MacJayne intervenes with decisive, if excessive, violence—his mighty sword separating the unfortunate guard from both his duty and his head in a single stroke. Such brutal efficiency catches Jos off guard, yet creates a bond of circumstance between them.

The key retrieved (after a bargain with a ghoul in the bone pit beneath the gibbet), Jos enlists MacJayne as escort to the Skull & Sword tavern in Glatney Street, a den of thieves and cutthroats in Lutetia's shadowed quarters. There, a case of mistaken identity leads Jos to approach a cloaked pair: a mysterious blind man named Vidocq, whose sightless eyes seem to perceive more than they should, and his dwarven companion, the stalwart Ahira, whose warhammer has tasted the blood of many foes.

When the actual targets of Jos's errand—the gang boss Hanmer and his halfling lieutenant Stoat—arrive, matters quickly deteriorate. Hanmer, harboring a grudge against Jos's mentor Colthan, leads Jos to a cellar where his intentions prove decidedly unwelcoming. MacJayne, Vidocq, and Ahira, sensing treachery, follow. The resulting confrontation leaves Stoat's neck broken in MacJayne's massive grip, and Hanmer at knife-point, bargaining for his life with tales of "Aramaina's Treasure" and a mysterious scout named Corin Quickpath.

During this negotiation, the companions discover [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus Thatch]]—scholar, mage, and apparently Hanmer's captive—locked in a cask and awaiting an unpleasant fate. The water nymph Quia, Rupus's familiar, emerges from hiding to greet her master's rescuers with a glittering splash.

As the newly formed party departs the tavern, they find their path blocked by angry patrons loyal to Hanmer. It is then that the final member of our band makes his entrance: Alvion, a flamboyant minstrel whose skill with the hurdy-gurdy proves as effective at distracting the mob as MacJayne's blade is at dispatching them.

Thus are the companions gathered: MacJayne of the Highlands, whose strength is matched only by his simple directness; Jos the elven rogue, whose arrows fly true and whose daggers find their mark in darkness; Vidocq, the blind seer whose perception transcends ordinary sight; Ahira the dwarf, steadfast as the mountains of his ancestors; [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus Thatch]], whose arcane knowledge and scholarly mind conceal unexpected depths; and Alvion, whose music charms both friend and foe alike. Not forgetting Quia, the capricious water nymph, bound to [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] through mysteries known only to themselves.

Little did they know, as they slipped away from the Skull & Sword into the midnight streets of Lutetia, that their chance meeting would lead them into ancient tombs, against necromantic horrors, through conflicts with agents of darkness, and ultimately into the very shadow of the legendary Veil of Elphame—an artifact of such power that its mere mention causes the wise to tremble and the foolish to covet.

But those tales are yet to come. For now, they seek only shelter for the night, and perhaps answers to the riddles they've been handed: a key to a mysterious door, rumors of a poacher-turned-mercenary who betrayed an elven queen, and whispers of a treasure beyond mortal reckoning.

The chronicle of their deeds begins here, in the taverns and back alleys of Lutetia, but will soon spread across the breadth of Gallia, inscribed not merely in these humble pages, but in the very fabric of history itself.
