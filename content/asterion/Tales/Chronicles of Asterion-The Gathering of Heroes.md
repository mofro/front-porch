In the year of our Lord 1226, when the mighty King Ludovic of Gallia and his brothers journeyed east on crusade, leaving the realm in the hands of regents and stewards, fortune's wheel turned in peculiar fashion to bring together a band of unlikely companions whose deeds would soon be whispered in taverns throughout the land.

The tale begins on a windswept knoll outside Lutetia where the kingdom's criminals dangled from the Falcon Hill gibbet, their decaying forms a warning to those who might defy law and crown. It was here that the towering Ferguson MacJayne, a barbarian from the northern highlands with vengeance burning in his heart and a claymore strapped to his back, first spied the lithe form of Jos, an elven rogue of uncommon skill, as she attempted to extract a key from the gullet of a hanged thief known as "Lucky Pete."

MacJayne, with his copper-red hair whipping in the wind and muscles rippling beneath his tartan, had ventured south to Gallia seeking fortune—though precisely how much might satisfy him remained unclear even to himself. The sight of the guard climbing to interrupt Jos's macabre surgery spurred the highlander to action. With a casual strength that belied his youth, he seized the ladder and impaled the unfortunate sentry upon the ground before separating the man's head from his shoulders with a single sweep of his mighty blade, all before Jos could utter a word of protest or thanks.

When Lucky Pete's corpse tumbled into the bone pit beneath the gibbet, Jos descended to find her prize claimed by a ghoul—a decaying horror with yellowed teeth and knife-like claws. Rather than engage the foul creature in combat, the pragmatic elf negotiated a trade: three fresh corpses for the key she sought, with the freshly slain guard comprising part of the bargain.

MacJayne, his purse as empty as his belly, readily agreed when Jos requested his escort to the notorious Skull & Sword tavern on Glatney Street, where the shadows seemed to move of their own accord and the smell of spilled blood mingled with that of spilled ale. It was here that a comedy of mistaken identities would further entwine the threads of destiny, as Jos approached a pair of cloaked figures of drastically different heights, believing them to be the gang boss Hanmer and his halfling lieutenant, Stoat.

Instead, she found herself face to face with the mysterious Vidocq, a blind elf possessed of uncanny senses and an aura of deadly competence, and his hired muscle—the dour dwarf Ahira, whose warhammer had cracked many a skull in service to whoever could afford his fee. When the actual Hanmer and Stoat arrived moments later, Jos bid MacJayne remain at the table while she followed them to conduct her business.

Vidocq's ears, keen beyond mortal understanding, caught the sounds of betrayal as Hanmer revealed his grudge against Jos's mentor, Colthan, and made clear his intent to prevent her departure. MacJayne, never one for subtlety, kicked down the door to Hanmer's backroom sanctuary. A sling bullet bounced harmlessly off his square jaw before he casually wrung Stoat's neck with one massive hand, the halfling's feet kicking uselessly in the air as the life left his body.

In the ensuing chaos, Jos evaded Hanmer's guards and pressed a knife to the gang leader's throat just as Vidocq and Ahira arrived to lend their support. The would-be ambushers had become the ambushed, and Hanmer, suddenly cooperative, shared what little he knew about "Aramaina's Treasure"—that only a poacher and mercenary scout named Corin "Quickpath," an old friend of Colthan's and the apparent lover of the Elf Queen at the time of her death, might know its fate.

As payment for his life, Hanmer surrendered two hundred silver coins, his ring, and an ornate elven knife before Jos delivered a chilling warning that should any harm befall her mentor, she would return to extract a price in blood. As the unlikely band prepared to depart, they heard thumping and muffled cries from a sealed cask in Hanmer's office.

Within they discovered [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus Thatch]], a scholar and magic-user of some repute, whose overdue debts had earned him confinement and a future as dog-training fodder. The mage, with his rumpled robes and ink-stained fingers, introduced his unusual familiar—Quia, a sprightly undine or water nymph who dwelled within a specially prepared waterskin at his hip.

As the growing band of misfits made for the exit, they found their path blocked by a menacing crowd of patrons loyal to Hanmer. It seemed blood might flow once more when the tavern's entertainer—a flamboyantly attired minstrel named Alvion—intervened, his hurdy-gurdy producing notes of such enchanting quality that the mob's attention was diverted long enough for our heroes to slip away into the night.

Thus were gathered six souls whose paths had never been meant to cross: MacJayne the barbarian, his mighty claymore thirsting for glory; Jos the elven rogue, her arrows as swift as her wit; Vidocq the blind seer, whose other senses rendered darkness meaningless; Ahira the dwarven warrior, as solid as the stone from which his people were said to be carved; [[Dramatis-Personae#Rupus Thatch|Rupus]] the scholar-mage, with his watery companion Quia; and [[Dramatis-Personae#Alvion Naeeries|Alvion]] the minstrel, whose music could soothe savage hearts.

Little did they know that the key taken from Lucky Pete's gullet would unlock not merely a door to the Great Keep's lower levels, but the first of many adventures that would test their mettle, challenge their beliefs, and forge them into something greater than the sum of their parts—heroes whose names would one day echo throughout the realm of Asterion.
